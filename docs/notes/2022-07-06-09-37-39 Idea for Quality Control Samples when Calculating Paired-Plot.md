# 2022-07-06-09-37-39 Idea for Quality Control Samples when Calculating Paired-Plot

Created: 2022-07-06 09:37:39

It would be worthwhile to add some quality control data to the paired-plot analysis script in the form of bag weights. With known outcomes, this quality control data should test if the calculations in the R script output the correct values for production and utilization.

The bag weights should have 3 sub-samples and 5 plots (15 samples for each site) for each exclosure plot, and 10 samples for residual plots at each site.

Each bag weights when totaled should equal 100 g per meter^2^. It might be safest so as to not confuse quality control data with real observations to make each bag weight uniform.

When calculating production, quality control data should equal 1,000 pounds per acre and/or 5,000 pounds per acre.

When calculating utilization, quality control data should equal 50% utilization and 90% utilization.
