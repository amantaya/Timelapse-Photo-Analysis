# 2022-06-20-11-09-19 Idea for Tracking Status of Each Camera Collection

Created: 2022-06-20 11:09:19

What am I trying to do?

I want to have a status tracking for each collection folder on a Kanban board.

~~1. re-tag all tasks by status (e.g., #metadata #rename)~~
~~2. use dataview or another plugin to get all of the tags related to particular task (or do I link?)~~
3. add the task to the kanban board
4. when the task is completed, move it to the next position on the kanban board
6.
