  abstract = {Successful software authorship de-anonymization has both software forensics applications and privacy implications. However, the process requires an efficient extraction of authorship attributes. The extraction of such attributes is very challenging, due to various software code formats from executable binaries with different toolchain provenance to source code with different programming languages. Moreover, the quality of attributes is bounded by the availability of software samples to a certain number of samples per author and a specific size for software samples. To this end, this work proposes a deep Learning-based approach for software authorship attribution, that facilitates large-scale, format-independent, language-oblivious, and obfuscation-resilient software authorship identification. This proposed approach incorporates the process of learning deep authorship attribution using a recurrent neural network, and ensemble random forest classifier for scalability to de-anonymize programmers. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach over the entire Google Code Jam (GCJ) dataset across all years (from 2008 to 2016) and over real-world code samples from 1,987 public repositories on GitHub. The results of our work show high accuracy despite requiring a smaller number of samples per author. Experimenting with source-code, our approach allows us to identify 8,903 GCJ authors, the largest-scale dataset used by far, with an accuracy of 92.3\%. Using the real-world dataset, we achieved an identification accuracy of 94.38\% for 745 C programmers on GitHub. Moreover, the proposed approach is resilient to language-specifics, and thus it can identify authors of four programming languages (e.g., C, C++, Java, and Python), and authors writing in mixed languages (e.g., Java/C++, Python/C++). Finally, our system is resistant to sophisticated obfuscation (e.g., using C Tigress) with an accuracy of 93.42\% for a set of 120 authors. Experimenting with executable binaries, our approach achieves 95.74\% for identifying 1,500 programmers of software binaries. Similar results were obtained when software binaries are generated with different compilation options, optimization levels, and removing of symbol information. Moreover, our approach achieves 93.86\% for identifying 1,500 programmers of obfuscated binaries using all features adopted in Obfuscator-LLVM tool.},

  abstract = {Ad hoc keyword search engines built using modern information retrieval methods do a good job of handling fine-grained queries. However, they perform poorly at facilitating spatial and spatially-embedded thematic exploration of the results, despite the fact that many queries, e.g. "civil war," refer to different documents and topics in different places. This is not for lack of data: geographic information, such as place names, events, and coordinates are common in unstructured document collections on the web. The associations between geographic and thematic contents in these documents can provide a rich groundwork to organize information for exploratory research. In this paper we describe the architecture of an interactive thematic map search engine, Frankenplace, designed to facilitate document exploration at the intersection of theme and place. The map interface enables a user to zoom the geographic context of their query in and out, and quickly explore through thousands of search results in a meaningful way. And by combining topic models with geographically contextualized search results, users can discover related topics based on geographic context. Frankenplace utilizes a novel indexing method called geoboost for boosting terms associated with cells on a discrete global grid. The resulting index factors in the geographic scale of the place or feature mentioned in related text, the relative textual scope of the place reference, and the overall importance of the containing document in the document network. The system is currently indexed with over 5 million documents from the web, including the English Wikipedia and online travel blog entries. We demonstrate that Frankenplace can support four distinct types of exploratory search tasks while being adaptive to scale and location of interest.},

  abstract = {Large herbivores can impose spatial patterns on otherwise homogeneous vegetation, but how these patterns change through time is poorly understood. Domestic livestock pastures are model systems for studying how foraging behavior influences the development of coupled grazing and vegetation patterns. We sampled forage production and utilization by cattle along distance-from-water gradients to provide a snapshot of grazing and vegetation patterns, and then evaluated the ability of simulation models to qualitatively reproduce these patterns. In the field, forage production increased with distance from water, as expected, but utilization peaked at intermediate distances from water in two of three study areas. Likewise, simulations based on a variety of foraging strategies produced gradients in forage production and, after forage availability near water declined sufficiently, peaks in utilization at intermediate distances. Distance-from-water gradients thus represent cumulative but not necessarily present day gradients in grazing intensity. The model with a foraging strategy based on time minimization produced slightly more realistic patterns in forage abundance than a model based on energy maximization, although results were sensitive to the value of the threshold for rejecting sites of low forage biomass. However, all models produced implausible thresholds in grazing and forage distribution, suggesting that factors besides resource distribution influence herbivore distributions. Moreover, different foraging rules produced similar vegetation gradients, especially on point water source landscapes, illustrating the difficulty of inferring foraging processes from vegetation patterns.},

  abstract = {Large herbivores can impose spatial patterns on otherwise homogeneous vegetation, but how these patterns change through time is poorly understood. Domestic livestock pastures are model systems for studying how foraging behavior influences the development of coupled grazing and vegetation patterns. We sampled forage production and utilization by cattle along distance-from-water gradients to provide a snapshot of grazing and vegetation patterns, and then evaluated the ability of simulation models to qualitatively reproduce these patterns. In the field, forage production increased with distance from water, as expected, but utilization peaked at intermediate distances from water in two of three study areas. Likewise, simulations based on a variety of foraging strategies produced gradients in forage production and, after forage availability near water declined sufficiently, peaks in utilization at intermediate distances. Distance-from-water gradients thus represent cumulative but not necessarily present day gradients in grazing intensity. The model with a foraging strategy based on time minimization produced slightly more realistic patterns in forage abundance than a model based on energy maximization, although results were sensitive to the value of the threshold for rejecting sites of low forage biomass. However, all models produced implausible thresholds in grazing and forage distribution, suggesting that factors besides resource distribution influence herbivore distributions. Moreover, different foraging rules produced similar vegetation gradients, especially on point water source landscapes, illustrating the difficulty of inferring foraging processes from vegetation patterns.},

  abstract = {The application of digital cameras to monitor the environment is becoming global and changing the way of phenological data collection. The technique of repeated digital photographs to monitor plant phenology (phenocams) has increased due to its low-cost investment, reduced size, easy set up installation, and the possibility of handling high-resolution near-remote data. Considering the widespread use of phenocams worldwide, our main goals here are: (i) to provide a step-by-step guide for phenocam set up in the tropics, reinforce its appliance as an efficient tool for monitoring tropical phenology and foster networking, (ii) to discuss phenocam applications for biological conservation, management, and ecological restoration. We provide the concepts and properties for image analysis which allow representing the phenological status of the vegetation. The association of a long-term imagery data with local sensors (e.g., meteorological stations and surface-atmosphere flux towers) allows a wide range of studies, especially linking phenological patterns to climatic drivers; and the impact of climate changes on plant responses. We show phenocams applications for conservation as to document disturbances and changes on vegetation structure, such as deforestation, fire events, and flooding and the vegetation recovery. Networks of phenocams are growing globally and represent an important tool for conservation and restoration, as it provides hourly to daily information of monitored systems spread over several sites, ecosystems, and climatic zones. Moreover, websites enriched by vegetation dynamic imagery data can promote science knowledge by engaging citizen science participation.},

Monitoring the seasonal variation of available forage may help to prevent vegetation from deterioration and help to ensure sustainable animal production. Therefore, seasonal variations in the amounts of available forage, and the contents of crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and digestible dry matter (DDM) were monitored for two years via both ground sampling and Sentinel 2A-derived NDVI data at semi-arid Bozdag Rangelands, Turkey.

Invasions of native plant communities by non-native species present major challenges for ecosystem management and conservation. Invasive annual grasses such as cheatgrass, medusahead, and ventenata are pervasive and continue to expand their distributions across imperiled sagebrush-steppe communities of the western United States. These invasive grasses alter native plant communities, ecosystem function, and fire regimes, threatening sagebrush ecosystem persistence. Spatial data describing the distribution and abundance of invasive species are often used by resource managers to identify, target, and determine needed interventions. However, there are challenges associated with translating these datasets into management actions. We conducted a review of available spatial products to assess advances in, and barriers to, applying contemporary model-based maps to support rangeland management. We found dozens of regional data products describing cheatgrass or annual herbaceous cover and few maps describing ventenata or medusahead. Over the past decade, IAG spatial data increased in spatial and temporal resolution and increasingly used response variables that indicate the severity of infestation such as percent cover. Despite improvements, use of such data is limited by the time required to find, compare, understand, and translate model-based maps into management strategy. There is also a need for products with higher spatial resolution and accuracy. In collaboration with a multipartner stakeholder group, we identified key considerations that guide selection of IAG spatial data products for use by land managers and other users.

  abstract = {Virtual fencing is a method of controlling animals without ground-based fencing. Control occurs by altering an animal's behaviour through one or more sensory cues administered to the animal after it has attempted to penetrate an electronically-generated boundary. This boundary can be of any geometrical shape, and though unseen by the eye, is detected by a computer system worn by the animal. The most recent autonomous programmable systems use radio frequency (RF) signals, emanating from global positioning system (GPS) satellites to generate boundaries. Algorithms within a geographic information system (GIS) within the device's computer use the GPS and other data to determine where on the animal a cue, or cues, should be applied and for how long. The first commercial virtual fencing system was patented in 1973 for controlling domestic dogs. Virtual fencing was used for the first time to control livestock in 1987. Since then proof-of-concept research using commercial, as well as custom designed systems have demonstrated that virtual fencing can successfully hold as well as move livestock over the landscape. Commercial virtual livestock control systems do not yet exist but research continues towards this goal. Pending research needs relating to this method of animal control are discussed in light of currently available technologies.},

  abstract = {Free-ranging livestock play a pivotal role globally in the conversion of plant tissue into products and services that support man's many and changing lifestyles. With domestication came the task of providing livestock with an adequate plane of nutrition while simultaneously managing vegetation for sustainable production. Attempting to meld these two seemingly opposing management goals continues to be a major focus of rangeland research. Demand for multiple goods and services from rangelands today requires that livestock production make the smallest possible `negative hoof-print'. Advancements in global navigation satellite system, geographic information systems, and electronic/computing technologies, coupled with improved understanding of animal behaviour, positions virtual fencing (VF) as an increasingly attractive option for managing free-ranging livestock. VF offers an alternative to conventional fencing by replacing physical barriers with sensory cues to control an animal's forward movement. Currently, audio and electrical stimulation are the cues employed. When VF becomes a commercial reality, manual labour will be replaced in large part with cognitive labour for real-time prescription-based livestock distribution management that is robust, accurate, precise and flexible. The goal is to manage rangeland ecosystems optimally for soils, plants, herbivores in addition to the plant and animal's microflora. However, maximising the benefits of VF will require a paradigm shift in management by using VF as a `virtual herder' rather than simply as a tool to manage livestock within static physical barriers.},

  abstract = {Sustainable management of grazinglands depends upon understanding how management practices influence livestock movements in space and time. We conducted a ranch-scale (2,600-ha) social-ecological experiment to examine how foraging behavior of cattle differs between a single large herd rotated adaptively among paddocks (collaborative, adaptive rangeland management; CARM) versus continuous, season-long grazing of paddocks by small non-rotational herds (traditional rangeland management; TRM). We analyzed how differences in cattle movement patterns may be linked to reductions in cattle growth rates and diet quality in the CARM treatment, relative to TRM. Cattle in the CARM treatment exhibited more linear grazing pathways, moved at lower velocity while grazing, and exhibited longer grazing bouts early in the growing season compared to TRM cattle. Grazing time within any given 10~\texttimes ~10~m area was distributed more unevenly across TRM vs. CARM paddocks in years with average or above-average precipitation, but not in dry years. In all years, areas of high and low grazing intensity were more spatially clustered in TRM than CARM paddocks. Movement patterns of cattle managed using adaptive, multi-paddock rotations at high stock density (CARM) are consistent with less selective foraging. Such cattle form a ``grazing front'' that moves across the paddock and distributes grazing pressure in a more spatially homogeneous fashion. In years with substantial forage production, TRM cattle spent more time than CARM cattle in preferred areas of the paddock and foraged in more circular patches. In dry years, however, both treatments resulted in similarly even grazing distribution, likely due to limited intra-paddock variation in forage quality and quantity. At the ranch scale, these different intra-paddock movement patterns led to reductions in animal growth rates and no overall effect of grazing management on forage production.},

  abstract = {We used very large scale aerial (VLSA) photography to quantify spatial patterns in bare soil in the northeastern Colorado shortgrass steppe. Using three pairs of pastures stocked at moderate (0.6 animal unit months \&lsqb;AUM]{$\mkern1mu\cdot\mkern1mu$}ha-1) versus very heavy (1.2 AUM{$\mkern1mu\cdot\mkern1mu$}ha-1) rates, we detected greater bare soil under very heavy (mean{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}22.5\%) versus moderate stocking (mean{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}13.5\%; P{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.053) and a lower coefficient of variation across pastures under very heavy (0.48) versus moderate stocking (0.75; P{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.032). Bare soil exhibited significant positive spatial autocorrelation across distances of 60\textendash 120~m under moderate stocking (Moran's I{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.14), while patchiness at this scale was eliminated under very heavy grazing (I{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}-0.05). Across distances of 120\textendash 480~m, we observed no spatial autocorrelation with either stocking rate. Spatial autocorrelation was greatest at a separation distance of 2~m (I{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.48\textendash 0.58) but was unaffected by stocking rate at this scale. Thus, very heavy grazing did not increase spatial autocorrelation in bare soil across scales of 2\textendash 480~m. Means and variability in the distribution of bare soil were not influenced by ecological site. Bare soil increased primarily at the scale of individual plant clusters through both increases in the density of small (2\textendash 20~cm) bare patch intercepts and increases in the frequency of bare patch intercepts of 20\textendash 60~cm (rather than \&spilt;{$\mkern1mu$}20~cm). Our approach demonstrates the utility of VLSA for analyzing interactions between grazing and other landscape features and highlights the importance of spatially explicit sampling across broad scales (pastures) while testing for potential shifts in patchiness of bare soil at the scale of plant interspaces. Resumen Utilizamos fotograf\'ia de escalas a\'ereas muy altas (VLSA) para cuantificar patrones espaciales en suelo desnudo en un pastizal de pastos cortos del noreste de Colorado. Usando tres pares de pastizales con carga animal moderada (0.6 unidades animal por mes \&lsqb;AUM]{$\mkern1mu\cdot\mkern1mu$}ha-1) compar\'andolos contra pastizales con cargas animales altas (1.2 AUM{$\mkern1mu\cdot\mkern1mu$}ha-1), detectamos una mayor cantidad de suelo desnudo en lugares con cargas animales altas (media{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}22.5\%) en comparaci\'on con las cargas animales moderadas (mean{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}13.5\%; P{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.053), y un bajo coeficiente de variaci\'on a trav\'es de pastizales con cargas animales muy altas (0.48) en comparaci\'on con cargas animales moderadas (0.75; P{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.032). El suelo desnudo present\'o auto-correlaciones significativas y positivas espaciales en las distancia de 60 a 120~m bajo una carga animal moderada (Moran's I{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.14), mientras, la agregaci\'on a esta escala se elimin\'o dentro de \'areas de carga animal alta (I{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}-0.05). A la escala de 120\textendash 480~m, no observamos correlaci\'on alguna con ninguna carga animal. La auto correlaci\'on espacial fue la mayor en la separaci\'on de 2~m (I{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.48\textendash 0.58) pero no fue afectada por ning\'un nivel de carga animal en esta escala. De esta manera los lugares pastoreados fuertemente no incrementaron la auto correlaci\'on espacial en suelo desnudo en la escala de 2\textendash 480~m. Las medias y la variabilidad en la distribuci\'on de suelo desnudo no fueron influenciadas por los sitios ecol\'ogicos. El suelo desnudo se increment\'o principalmente en las escalas de plantas individuales y agregados, ambas mediante el incremento en la densidad de peque\~nas intercepciones de suelo desnudo (2\textendash 20~cm), e incrementos en la frecuencia de intercepciones de suelo desnudo de 20 a 60~m (en lugar de \&spilt;{$\mkern1mu$}20~cm). Nuestro enfoque demuestra la utilidad de VLSA para analizar interacciones entre el pastoreo y otras caracter\'isticas del paisaje, y recalca la importancia del muestreo espacialmente explicito a trav\'es de amplias escalas (pastizales) mientras se eval\'ua el potencial de cambio de \'areas a suelo desnudo a la escala de espacios entre plantas.},

  abstract = {We used very large scale aerial (VLSA) photography to quantify spatial patterns in bare soil in the northeastern Colorado shortgrass steppe. Using three pairs of pastures stocked at moderate (0.6 animal unit months \&lsqb;AUM]1mu{$\cdot$}1muha-1) versus very heavy (1.2 AUM1mu{$\cdot$}1muha-1) rates, we detected greater bare soil under very heavy (mean1mu1mu=1mu1mu22.5\%) versus moderate stocking (mean1mu1mu=1mu1mu13.5\%; P1mu1mu=1mu1mu0.053) and a lower coefficient of variation across pastures under very heavy (0.48) versus moderate stocking (0.75; P1mu1mu=1mu1mu0.032). Bare soil exhibited significant positive spatial autocorrelation across distances of 60\textendash 120 m under moderate stocking (Moran's I1mu1mu=1mu1mu0.14), while patchiness at this scale was eliminated under very heavy grazing (I1mu1mu=1mu1mu-0.05). Across distances of 120\textendash 480 m, we observed no spatial autocorrelation with either stocking rate. Spatial autocorrelation was greatest at a separation distance of 2 m (I1mu1mu=1mu1mu0.48\textendash 0.58) but was unaffected by stocking rate at this scale. Thus, very heavy grazing did not increase spatial autocorrelation in bare soil across scales of 2\textendash 480 m. Means and variability in the distribution of bare soil were not influenced by ecological site. Bare soil increased primarily at the scale of individual plant clusters through both increases in the density of small (2\textendash 20 cm) bare patch intercepts and increases in the frequency of bare patch intercepts of 20\textendash 60 cm (rather than \&spilt;1mu20 cm). Our approach demonstrates the utility of VLSA for analyzing interactions between grazing and other landscape features and highlights the importance of spatially explicit sampling across broad scales (pastures) while testing for potential shifts in patchiness of bare soil at the scale of plant interspaces. Resumen Utilizamos fotograf\'ia de escalas a\'ereas muy altas (VLSA) para cuantificar patrones espaciales en suelo desnudo en un pastizal de pastos cortos del noreste de Colorado. Usando tres pares de pastizales con carga animal moderada (0.6 unidades animal por mes \&lsqb;AUM]1mu{$\cdot$}1muha-1) compar\'andolos contra pastizales con cargas animales altas (1.2 AUM1mu{$\cdot$}1muha-1), detectamos una mayor cantidad de suelo desnudo en lugares con cargas animales altas (media1mu1mu=1mu1mu22.5\%) en comparaci\'on con las cargas animales moderadas (mean1mu1mu=1mu1mu13.5\%; P1mu1mu=1mu1mu0.053), y un bajo coeficiente de variaci\'on a trav\'es de pastizales con cargas animales muy altas (0.48) en comparaci\'on con cargas animales moderadas (0.75; P1mu1mu=1mu1mu0.032). El suelo desnudo present\'o auto-correlaciones significativas y positivas espaciales en las distancia de 60 a 120 m bajo una carga animal moderada (Moran's I1mu1mu=1mu1mu0.14), mientras, la agregaci\'on a esta escala se elimin\'o dentro de \'areas de carga animal alta (I1mu1mu=1mu1mu-0.05). A la escala de 120\textendash 480 m, no observamos correlaci\'on alguna con ninguna carga animal. La auto correlaci\'on espacial fue la mayor en la separaci\'on de 2 m (I1mu1mu=1mu1mu0.48\textendash 0.58) pero no fue afectada por ning\'un nivel de carga animal en esta escala. De esta manera los lugares pastoreados fuertemente no incrementaron la auto correlaci\'on espacial en suelo desnudo en la escala de 2\textendash 480 m. Las medias y la variabilidad en la distribuci\'on de suelo desnudo no fueron influenciadas por los sitios ecol\'ogicos. El suelo desnudo se increment\'o principalmente en las escalas de plantas individuales y agregados, ambas mediante el incremento en la densidad de peque\~nas intercepciones de suelo desnudo (2\textendash 20 cm), e incrementos en la frecuencia de intercepciones de suelo desnudo de 20 a 60 m (en lugar de \&spilt;1mu20 cm). Nuestro enfoque demuestra la utilidad de VLSA para analizar interacciones entre el pastoreo y otras caracter\'isticas del paisaje, y recalca la importancia del muestreo espacialmente explicito a trav\'es de amplias escalas (pastizales) mientras se eval\'ua el potencial de cambio de \'areas a suelo desnudo a la escala de espacios entre plantas.},

  abstract = {Livestock-w\- ildlife interactions in rangelands are often viewed in terms of competition, but livestock and native ungulates can also benefit each other through long-\- term modifications of rangeland habitats. Here we synthesize research on rangelands in central Laikipia focusing on two types of cattle-\-wildlife interactions that have implications for their long-\-term coexistence. The first interaction occurs via redistribution of soil nutrients within the ecosystem, which is a consequence of the use of bomas (temporary corrals) to manage livestock. Our studies on two different soil types show that rotational boma management creates hectare-s\- cale patches in the landscape that are enriched in soil and plant nutrients and persist for decades to centuries. In both of the predominant soil types in Laikipia, forage phosphorus content is low relative to ungulate demands during peak lactation. Nutrient-r\-ich boma sites (hereafter referred to as glades) provide a key wet-s\-eason forage resource of nutritional sufficiency for lactation. Our studies further show that a wide range of native ungulates selectively use glades relative to surrounding nutrient-p\- oor habitats. Impala (Aepyceros melampus) in particular show intensive use of glades on sandy soils and are rare in portions of the landscape lacking glades. A second important pathway for cattle-w\- ildlife interaction occurs through the influence of native browsing ungulates on woody vegetation. Shrub and tree cover has been increasing in Laikipia over the past century, followed by increases in native browsers in recent decades on ranches where wildlife are allowed to coexist with cattle. Our exclosure experiments in central Laikipia indicate that native browsers suppress shrub encroachment on both dominant soil types. However, the strength of browser effects are three to seven times greater on sandy soils, where two browsers, dik-\-dik and elephants, are both abundant, compared to heavy clay soils, where elephants are the only dominant browser. In the clay soils, native browsers still exert a significant influence on dynamics of the dominant tree, Acacia drepanolobium, and suppress encroachment by subdominant shrub species. Browser effects on woody vegetation likely enhance forage production for cattle and maintain open habitats favored by native grazers for predator avoidance. Taken together, our studies indicate that boma rotation and browser control of shrub encroachment are key interaction pathways that promote cattle-w\- ildlife coexistence in the Ewaso ecosystem.},

Diets were determined through microhistological fecal analysis from 1998 to 2000, and forage selection was evaluated at feeding sites in aspen and sagebrush communities in 1999 and 2000. Elk spring diets were the most diverse in composition; summer elk diets were dominated by forbs (59\%\textendash 78\%); deer consumed mostly woody browse (64\%\textendash 72\%); and cattle and sheep ate mostly graminoids. Lupines (Lupinus spp. L.) constituted\,{$\geq$}\,11\% of elk, deer, and sheep diets in summer. Spurred lupine (Lupinus caudatus Kellogg) was the lupine typically selected in feeding sites and greatest consumption occurred in summer when total alkaloid levels were lowest. Highest diet overlap was between cattle and sheep in 1999 (68\%) and lowest between deer and cattle in 2000 (3\%). Summer elk and deer diets overlapped moderately (45\%\textendash 59\%). Diets did not differ between elk in spring with sheep, elk in summer with deer and sheep, or cattle with sheep. Cattle foraged selectively on forbs in aspen communities (68\%) and on graminoids in sagebrush communities (88\%), reflecting relative forage availabilities. We detected no differences among elk, cattle, and sheep for forage selection in aspen communities. Electivity indices indicated elk preferred forbs in aspen and sagebrush communities; cattle preferred graminoids in sagebrush; and foraging sheep preferred forbs in aspen. Our results suggest potential for forage competition among ungulates on aspen\textendash sagebrush summer range is highest for forbs in aspen communities. Monitoring productivity and use of key forage species, particularly forbs in aspen communities, should complement management objectives on shared aspen\textendash sagebrush summer range. Resumen Las Comunidades de Aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux) y Sagebrush (Artemisia spp. L.) Son importantes fuentes de forraje par los ungulados que habitan muchos de los pastizales de verano del oeste; sin embargo, la informaci\'on sobre la competencia potencial por el forraje en estas comunidades es limitada. Con el prop\'osito de entender la competencia potencial por el forraje y suministrar mejor informaci\'on para el manejo de estas comunidades vegetales evaluamos la composici\'on y similitud de la dieta y la selecci\'on de forraje del alce (Cervus elaphus), venado (Odocoileus hemionus), bovinos (Bos taurus) y ovinos (Ovis aries) apacentando un pastizal de verano de aspen\textendash sagebrush del nordeste de Nevada. La dietas se determinaron mediante an\'alisis microhistol\'ogico de heces fecales de 1998 al 2000 y en 1999 y 2000 se evalu\'o la selecci\'on de forraje en los sitios de alimentaci\'on de las comunidades de aspen y sagebrush.

  abstract = {We evaluated elk (Cervus elaphus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), cattle (Bos taurus), and domestic sheep (Ovis aries) diet composition, diet overlap, and forage selection on aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux)\textendash sagebrush (Artemisia spp. L.) summer range in northeastern Nevada to understand potential for forage competition to provide better information for managing these communities. Diets were determined through microhistological fecal analysis from 1998 to 2000, and forage selection was evaluated at feeding sites in aspen and sagebrush communities in 1999 and 2000. Elk spring diets were the most diverse in composition; summer elk diets were dominated by forbs (59\%\textendash 78\%); deer consumed mostly woody browse (64\%\textendash 72\%); and cattle and sheep ate mostly graminoids. Lupines (Lupinus spp. L.) constituted\,{$\geq$}\,11\% of elk, deer, and sheep diets in summer. Spurred lupine (Lupinus caudatus Kellogg) was the lupine typically selected in feeding sites and greatest consumption occurred in summer when total alkaloid levels were lowest. Highest diet overlap was between cattle and sheep in 1999 (68\%) and lowest between deer and cattle in 2000 (3\%). Summer elk and deer diets overlapped moderately (45\%\textendash 59\%). Diets did not differ between elk in spring with sheep, elk in summer with deer and sheep, or cattle with sheep. Cattle foraged selectively on forbs in aspen communities (68\%) and on graminoids in sagebrush communities (88\%), reflecting relative forage availabilities. We detected no differences among elk, cattle, and sheep for forage selection in aspen communities. Electivity indices indicated elk preferred forbs in aspen and sagebrush communities; cattle preferred graminoids in sagebrush; and foraging sheep preferred forbs in aspen. Our results suggest potential for forage competition among ungulates on aspen\textendash sagebrush summer range is highest for forbs in aspen communities. Monitoring productivity and use of key forage species, particularly forbs in aspen communities, should complement management objectives on shared aspen\textendash sagebrush summer range. Resumen Las Comunidades de Aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux) y Sagebrush (Artemisia spp. L.) Son importantes fuentes de forraje par los ungulados que habitan muchos de los pastizales de verano del oeste; sin embargo, la informaci\'on sobre la competencia potencial por el forraje en estas comunidades es limitada. Con el prop\'osito de entender la competencia potencial por el forraje y suministrar mejor informaci\'on para el manejo de estas comunidades vegetales evaluamos la composici\'on y similitud de la dieta y la selecci\'on de forraje del alce (Cervus elaphus), venado (Odocoileus hemionus), bovinos (Bos taurus) y ovinos (Ovis aries) apacentando un pastizal de verano de aspen\textendash sagebrush del nordeste de Nevada. La dietas se determinaron mediante an\'alisis microhistol\'ogico de heces fecales de 1998 al 2000 y en 1999 y 2000 se evalu\'o la selecci\'on de forraje en los sitios de alimentaci\'on de las comunidades de aspen y sagebrush. Las dietas del alce en primavera fueron las m\'as diversas en composici\'on, y en verano, su dieta estuvo dominada por hierbas (59\%\textendash 78\%); el venado consumi\'o principalmente especies le\~nosas (64\%\textendash 72\%) y los bovinos y ovinos comieron principalmente gram\'ineas. Los lupinos (Lupinus spp. L.) constituyeron\,{$\geq$}\,11\% de la dieta de verano del alce, venado y ovinos. El ``Spurred lupine'' (Lupinus caudatus Kellogg) fue el ``Lupino'' t\'ipicamente seleccionado por los ungulados en los sitios de alimentaci\'on y el mayor consumo ocurri\'o en verano cuando los niveles totales de alcaloides fueron los m\'as bajos. La mayor similitud de la dieta se registr\'o en 1999 entre los bovinos y ovinos (68\%) y el menor entre el venado y los bovinos en el 2000 (3\%). En verano, las dietas del alce y el venado se traslaparon moderadamente (45\%\textendash 59\%). En primavera la dieta del alce y los ovinos no difiri\'o, lo mismo ocurri\'o en verano con la dieta del alce, el venado y los ovinos y la dieta de los bovinos y ovinos. Los bovinos apacentaron selectivamente las hierbas en las comunidades de aspen (68\%) y en las gram\'ineas en las comunidades de sagebrush (88\%), reflejando disponibilidades relativas de forraje. En las comunidades de aspen no detectamos diferencias entre el alce, bovinos y ovinos en la selectividad de forraje.

Because feral horses exhibit watering behavior markedly different from that of domestic cattle, it is particularly important to evaluate response of ecosystem elements near water sources to horse use. To assess this response, we performed live-trapping of small mammals and 2-tiered vegetative sampling in 2 mountain ranges in central Nevada in the interior Great Basin, USA. At low elevations, plots around horse-excluded springs exhibited notably greater plant species richness, percent cover, and abundance of grasses and shrubs, as well as more small mammal burrow entrances than plots at horse-grazed springs. At high elevations, meadows protected from grazing exhibited maximum vegetation heights 2.8 times greater than vegetation grazed by horses only and 4.5 times greater than vegetation grazed by horses and cattle. Species richness in quadrats was most different between the horse-and-cattle-grazed meadow and its ungrazed counterpart, suggesting the possibility of synergistic effects of horse and cattle grazing in the same location. This study, the first in the Great Basin to investigate quantitatively ecosystem consequences of feral horse use with exclosures, represents a preliminary step in identifying factors that determine the magnitude of horse grazing impacts.}

  abstract = {The inadaptability of the frightening devices to the behavioral-change exhibited by grazing animals has been a great challenge in developing animal detection and recognition system that can prevent animal intrusion to a prohibited area. Animal distribution is something that is challenging and that does not have an immediate answer to. In fact, literature shows that just in the last few years, more than 68 different strategies have been used trying to affect animal distribution. These include putting a fence in, developing drinking water in a new location, putting supplemental feed at different locations, changing the times feed is put out, putting in artificial shade so that animals would move to that location, using identification means such as ear tags, radio frequency identification, tattooing, marking, branding, and biometrics. There are a host of frightening strategies that have been used to scare animals from intruding prohibited area; these include installing frightening devices such as explosive materials, acoustics and bioacoustics gadgets, and so on. Moreover, they all work under certain conditions; some of them work even better when they are used synergistically. Sooner or later, these animals become accustomed to most of the frightening techniques put in place to prevent them from going beyond their boundaries or intruding the prohibited area. Virtual fencing (VF) and global positioning system (GPS) are the recent technology developed to handle the challenges that come with animal grazing behavior. Recent advances in GPS and VF technology have allowed the development of free-range and lightweight GPS collar tools suitable for monitoring animal behavioral changes.},

The effect of infrastructure on bird populations extended over distances up to about 1km, and for mammal populations up to about 5km.

The effect of infrastructure on bird populations extended over distances up to about 1km, and for mammal populations up to about 5km. Mammals and birds seemed to avoid infrastructure in open areas over larger distances compared to forested areas, which could be related to the reduced visibility of the infrastructure in forested areas. We did not find a significant effect of traffic intensity on the MSA of birds. Species varied in their response to infrastructure. Raptors were found to be more abundant in the proximity of infrastructure whereas other bird taxa tended to avoid it. Abundances were affected at variable distances from infrastructure: within a few meters for small-sized mammals and up to several hundred meters for large-sized mammals. Our findings show the importance of minimizing infrastructure development for wildlife conservation in relatively undisturbed areas. By combining actual species distributions with the effect distance functions we developed, regions sensitive to infrastructure development may be identified. Additionally, the effect distance functions can be used in models in support of decision making on infrastructure planning.},

  abstract = {Managing livestock movement in extensive systems has environmental and production benefits. Currently permanent wire fencing is used to control cattle; this is both expensive and inflexible. Cattle are known to respond to auditory and visual cues and we investigated whether these can be used to manipulate their behaviour. Twenty-five Belmont Red steers with a mean live weight of 270 kg were each randomly assigned to one of five treatments. Treatments consisted of a combination of cues (audio, tactile and visual stimuli) and consequence (electrical stimulation). The treatments were electrical stimulation alone, audio plus electrical stimulation, vibration plus electrical stimulation, light plus electrical stimulation and electrified electric fence (6 kV) plus electrical stimulation. Cue stimuli were administered for 3 s followed immediately by electrical stimulation (consequence) of 1 kV for 1 s. The experiment tested the operational efficacy of an on-animal control or virtual fencing system. A collar\textendash halter device was designed to carry the electronics, batteries and equipment providing the stimuli, including audio, vibration, light and electrical of a prototype virtual fencing device. Cattle were allowed to travel along a 40 m alley to a group of peers and feed while their rate of travel and response to the stimuli were recorded. The prototype virtual fencing system was successful in modifying the behaviour of the cattle. The rate of travel of cattle along the alley demonstrated the large variability in behavioural response associated with tactile, visual and audible cues. The experiment demonstrated virtual fencing has potential for controlling cattle in extensive grazing systems. However, larger numbers of cattle need to be tested to derive a better understanding of the behavioural variance. Further controlled experimental work is also necessary to quantify the interaction between cues, consequences and cattle learning.},

Models showed that a decrease in extended spring precipitation from 150 to 50~mm was associated with loss of one-quarter to one-half of plots' total grass cover. Association of grass declines with this novel season of drought is especially relevant because global circulation models predict steep declines in spring rainfall. Increasing E.~lehmanniana dominance was also associated with native grass declines. There was little support over this time for predicted effects of livestock grazing or shrub encroachment. This study demonstrated how monitoring data from working landscapes can improve ecological understanding of drought.

  abstract = {Ground cover is a key indicator of rangeland condition and influences rangeland management decisions, yet there have been few advances in ground-cover measurement methods. The advent of digital photography and automated image processing promise a revolution in the way ground cover is measured. To assess the potential for automation we compared conventional and automated methods for measuring ground cover against known artificial populations. The known populations were created from 20 nadir images of a Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle \& Young) vegetation type acquired with a 5-megapixel Olympus E20 digital single lens reflex camera mounted on an aluminum camera frame at 2m above ground level. The images were converted to color, 2-dimensional images that no longer represented real-world conditions but had known cover values and conserved a simplified form of the pattern and spatial context of the plant community. These images were then printed at 1:1 scale to a 1 \texttimes{} 1-m poster. Posters were evaluated for color cover under laboratory conditions using the conventional techniques of steel-point frame, laser-point frame, line-point intercept, ocular estimation, and line intercept. Photographs of the posters were measured for color cover using standard and custom-created algorithms within the VegMeasure image analysis framework, and using the Digital Grid Overlay method. Results indicate that conventional techniques had significantly greater correlation ({$\geq$} 92\% agreement of measured to known) than measurements from the algorithms used in the VegMeasure analysis (70\%). The critical factor influencing accuracy of point-sampling methods was the area of the contact point for the given method. These findings provide an important measure of relative accuracy among methods for land managers and for researchers seeking to improve rangeland monitoring methods. Resumen La cobertura basal es un indicador clave de la condici\'on del pastizal e influye en las decisiones de manejo del pastizal; sin embargo, ha habido pocos avances en los m\'etodos de medici\'on de la cobertura basal. El advenimiento de la fotograf\'ia digital y el procesamiento autom\'atico de im\'agenes promete un revoluci\'on en la forma en la que la cobertura basal es medida. Pare evaluar el potencial de automatizaci\'on, comparamos m\'etodos convencionales y automatizados para medir la cobertura basal, la comparaci\'on se realiz\'o en poblaciones artificiales de cobertura conocida. Las poblaciones artificiales fueron creadas a partir de 20 im\'agenes de baja altura de un tipo de vegetaci\'on de ``Wyoming big sagebrush'' (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle \& Young) tomadas con una c\'amara digital Olympus E20 de 5 megapixeles con lente reflex simple montada en un marco de aluminio a dos metros de altura del nivel del suelo. Las im\'agenes se convirtieron a color y en im\'agenes de dos dimensiones que ya no representaban el mundo real, pero ten\'ian valores conocidos de cobertura y conservaron una forma simplificada del patr\'on y contexto espacial de la comunidad vegetal. Posteriormente estas im\'agenes fueron impresas en una escala de 1:1 en un poster de 1 \texttimes{} 1m. Los posters fueron evaluados bajo condiciones de laboratorio para determinar la cobertura por clase de color, para ello se usaron las siguientes t\'ecnicas convencionales: marco de puntos de acero, marco de puntos l\'aser, l\'inea de intercepci\'on de puntos, estimaci\'on ocular, y la l\'inea de intercepci\'on. As\'i mismo, la cobertura por clase de color de los posters se midi\'o usando algoritmos est\'andar y especiales dentro del protocolo de an\'alisis de im\'agenes VegMeasure y usando el m\'etodo de la capa de malla digital. Los resultados indican que las t\'ecnicas convencionales tuvieron una correlaci\'on significativamente mayor ({$\geq$} 92\% de concordancia de lo medido con lo conocido) que las mediciones de cobertura derivadas de los algoritmos usados en el an\'alisis de VegMeasure (70\%). El factor critico que influenci\'o la exactitud de los m\'etodos de muestreo de puntos fue el \'area de contacto del punto. Estos hallazgos proveen una medida importante de la exactitud relativa entre los m\'etodos evaluados la cual es de utilidad para los manejadores de pastizales e investigadores que buscan mejorar los m\'etodos de monitoreo de los pastizales.},

These findings provide an important measure of relative accuracy among methods for land managers and for researchers seeking to improve rangeland monitoring methods. Resumen La cobertura basal es un indicador clave de la condici\'on del pastizal e influye en las decisiones de manejo del pastizal; sin embargo, ha habido pocos avances en los m\'etodos de medici\'on de la cobertura basal. El advenimiento de la fotograf\'ia digital y el procesamiento autom\'atico de im\'agenes promete un revoluci\'on en la forma en la que la cobertura basal es medida. Pare evaluar el potencial de automatizaci\'on, comparamos m\'etodos convencionales y automatizados para medir la cobertura basal, la comparaci\'on se realiz\'o en poblaciones artificiales de cobertura conocida. Las poblaciones artificiales fueron creadas a partir de 20 im\'agenes de baja altura de un tipo de vegetaci\'on de ``Wyoming big sagebrush'' (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle \& Young) tomadas con una c\'amara digital Olympus E20 de 5 megapixeles con lente reflex simple montada en un marco de aluminio a dos metros de altura del nivel del suelo. Las im\'agenes se convirtieron a color y en im\'agenes de dos dimensiones que ya no representaban el mundo real, pero ten\'ian valores conocidos de cobertura y conservaron una forma simplificada del patr\'on y contexto espacial de la comunidad vegetal. Posteriormente estas im\'agenes fueron impresas en una escala de 1:1 en un poster de 1 \texttimes{} 1m. Los posters fueron evaluados bajo condiciones de laboratorio para determinar la cobertura por clase de color, para ello se usaron las siguientes t\'ecnicas convencionales: marco de puntos de acero, marco de puntos l\'aser, l\'inea de intercepci\'on de puntos, estimaci\'on ocular, y la l\'inea de intercepci\'on. As\'i mismo, la cobertura por clase de color de los posters se midi\'o usando algoritmos est\'andar y especiales dentro del protocolo de an\'alisis de im\'agenes VegMeasure y usando el m\'etodo de la capa de malla digital. Los resultados indican que las t\'ecnicas convencionales tuvieron una correlaci\'on significativamente mayor ({$\geq$} 92\% de concordancia de lo medido con lo conocido) que las mediciones de cobertura derivadas de los algoritmos usados en el an\'alisis de VegMeasure (70\%). El factor critico que influenci\'o la exactitud de los m\'etodos de muestreo de puntos fue el \'area de contacto del punto. Estos hallazgos proveen una medida importante de la exactitud relativa entre los m\'etodos evaluados la cual es de utilidad para los manejadores de pastizales e investigadores que buscan mejorar los m\'etodos de monitoreo de los pastizales.},

  abstract = {Management of rangelands, and natural resources in general, has become increasingly complex. There is an atmosphere of increasing expectations for conservation efforts associated with a variety of issues from water quality to endangered species. We argue that many current issues are complex by their nature, which influences how we approach them. We define a complex problem as one that varies in time and space. In other words, one answer may not be correct for all sites or during all years. For simple problems a generalized answer may be sufficient, and even for complex problems, general rules provide a good starting point. However, we suggest that it is important to distinguish between simple and complex problems. Several key obstacles emerge when considering complex natural resource problems, namely, 1) no single entity can handle all aspects of the problem and 2) significant knowledge gaps exist and will continue to exist into the future. We suggest that overcoming these obstacles will benefit from 1) a framework for effective partnerships and 2) a mechanism for continuous learning. Managing complex problems will require some combination of the following: 1) a process-based understanding of the problem (i.e., what causes variation in time and space), 2) adaptive management, and 3) effective coordination of research and management. There are many examples of organizations applying portions of these approaches to complex problems; however, it seems that in many cases the process has simply evolved in that direction rather than being a planned strategy. We suggest that as a profession we need to have a discussion about the nature of the problems we are addressing and how researchers and managers can jointly address these problems. Resumen El manejo de pastizales naturales, y de los recursos naturales en general, se ha tornado cada vez m\'as complejo. Existe un ambiente de expectativas crecientes en cuanto a los esfuerzos de conservaci\'on asociados con una variedad de tem\'aticas que abarcan desde la calidad del agua hasta especies en peligro de extinci\'on. Sostenemos que mucha de la problem\'atica actual es intr\'insecamente compleja, y que dicha complejidad incide en el modo en que abordamos esta problem\'atica. Definimos un problema complejo como aquel que var\'ia a trav\'es del tiempo y el espacio. Es decir que una respuesta podr\'ia no ser la soluci\'on correcta para todos los sitios ni para todos los a\~nos. Las respuestas generales son casi siempre suficientes para la resoluci\'on de problemas sencillos, y a\'un el caso de problemas complejos, las reglas generales constituyen un buen punto de partida. No obstante, sugerimos que es importante distinguir entre problemas sencillos y complejos. Existen varios obst\'aculos clave que emergen cuando se consideran problemas complejos asociados con los recursos naturales: 1) ninguna entidad por si sola puede abordar todos los aspectos de un problema y 2) existen vac\'ios de conocimiento considerables que continuar\'an existiendo en el futuro. Proponemos que sortear estos obst\'aculos producir\'a como beneficios: 1) un marco para la generaci\'on de asociaciones efectivas y 2) un mecanismo para el aprendizaje continuo. El manejo de problemas complejos requerir\'a una combinaci\'on de los siguientes factores: 1) una comprensi\'on del problema basado en procesos (es decir, qu\'e es lo que genera la variaci\'on en el tiempo y el espacio), 2) manejo adaptativo, y 3) coordinaci\'on efectiva entre actividades de investigaci\'on y manejo. Existen muchos ejemplos de organizaciones que aplican porciones de estos enfoques para la resoluci\'on de problemas complejos, sin embargo, en muchos casos parecer\'ia que el proceso ha evolucionado en esta direcci\'on sin mediar una estrategia planificada. Proponemos que como profesi\'on debemos tener una discusi\'on sobre la naturaleza de los problemas que estamos abordando y sobre el modo en que los sectores de investigaci\'on y manejo pueden abordar dichos problemas conjuntamente.},

  abstract = {In this study, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a quick and safe method for monitoring biotic resources was evaluated. Vegetation cover and the amount of bare ground are important factors in understanding the sustainability of many ecosystems. Methods that improve speed and cost efficiency could greatly improve how biotic resources are monitored on western lands. Sagebrush steppe ecosystems provide important habitat for a variety of species including sage grouse and pygmy rabbit. Improved methods of monitoring these habitats are needed because not enough resource specialists or funds are available for comprehensive on-the-ground evaluations. In this project, two UAV platforms, fixed-wing and helicopter, were used to collect still-frame imagery to assess vegetation cover in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. This paper discusses the process for collecting and analyzing imagery from the UAVs to 1) estimate percentage of cover for six different vegetation types (shrub, dead shrub, grass, forb, litter, and bare ground) and 2) locate sage grouse using representative decoys. The field plots were located on the Idaho National Laboratory site west of Idaho Falls, Idaho, in areas with varying amounts and types of vegetation cover. A software program called SamplePoint was used along with visual inspection to evaluate percentage of cover for the six cover types. Results were compared against standard field measurements to assess accuracy. The comparison of fixed-wing and helicopter UAV technology against field estimates shows good agreement for the measurement of bare ground. This study shows that if a high degree of detail and data accuracy is desired, then a helicopter UAV may be a good platform to use. If the data collection objective is to assess broad-scale landscape level changes, then the collection of imagery with a fixed-wing system is probably more appropriate. Resumen En este estudio se evalu\'o el uso de veh\'iculos a\'ereos no tripulados (VANT) como un m\'etodo r\'apido y seguro para monitorear recursos bi\'oticos. La cubierta vegetal y la cantidad de suelo desnudo son factores importantes para entender la sustentabilidad de varios ecosistemas. M\'etodos que mejoren la rapidez y el costo podr\'ian mejorar la manera en que los recursos bi\'oticos de las tierras del oeste son monitoreados. El ecosistema de estepa de artemisa provee h\'abitat para varias especies que incluyen al ganso sage y conejo pigmeo. Es necesario mejorar los m\'etodos de monitoreo de estos h\'abitat porque no hay suficientes especialistas en recursos o fondos disponibles para evaluaciones completas en el terreno. En este proyecto, se utilizaron dos plataformas de VANT, alas fijas y helic\'optero para recolectar im\'agenes fotogr\'aficas para evaluar la cubierta vegetal en un ecosistema de estepa de artemisa. En este art\'iculo se discute el proceso de recolecci\'on y an\'alisis de im\'agenes de un VANT para 1) estimar el porcentaje de cubierta de seis diferentes tipos de vegetaci\'on (matorral, matorral seco, zacate, hierbas, mantillo y suelo desnudo) y 2) ubicar gansos sage usando se\~nuelos. Las parcelas experimentales se ubicaron en el Laboratorio Nacional de Idaho sitio localizado en Idaho Falls, Idaho en \'areas con diferentes cantidades y tipos de cubierta vegetal. Se uso el programa de software SamplePoint junto con inspecciones oculares para evaluar el porcentaje de cubierta de seis tipos de cubiertas. Los resultados se compararon contra medidas de campo est\'andar para evaluar su precisi\'on. La comparaci\'on de la tecnolog\'ia de helic\'optero VANT y alas fijas contra estimaciones de campo muestra buena relaci\'on para las medidas de suelo desnudo. El estudio muestra que s\'i se requiere alto grado de detalle y precisi\'on en los datos el helic\'optero VANT podr\'ia ser una buena plataforma para usarse. Pero s\'i el objetivo de recopilaci\'on de datos, es evaluar a gran escala los niveles de cambio en el paisaje entonces, la recopilaci\'on de im\'agenes con el sistema de alas fijas es probablemente m\'as apropiado.},

The objective of this technical note is to present a method for quickly processing uniform datasets using a commonly available commercial GPS collar and Program R. Data generated by a Lotek 3300LR GPS collar were processed in seconds using ``Lotek\_Function,'' which was developed using R coding. Traditional hand-processing of the same data generally requires 30 or more minutes and is prone to error due to the tedious, repetitive nature of the task. Due to the open-source nature of Program R, base codes can be modified to fit specific researchers' needs when incorporating GIS data layers or models to assess behavior based on motion sensor data output from collars.},

\par
``In most cases, preprocessing data just to get it into ArcGIS can involve as many as 30 steps.'' (Brennan et al., 2019, p. 615)
\par
``Lotek collars output data into two separate files, one containing GPS fix data and a second contain- ing activity sensor file data. The activity sensor records include the date- time stamp, a measure of activity on the X and Y axis, as well as an esti- mate on the percentage of time the animal's head was down for the 5- minute interval. The GPS fix and paired sensor files from the example dataset contain 8 094 records each, which is equivalent to approximately 28 d of data collection. Fix and sensor records were downloaded from the GPS collar and converted to comma-separated value (.txt) files using the GPS3000 host software provided by Lotek. These files cannot be incorpo- rated directly into ArcGIS due to numerous formatting issues.'' (Brennan et al., 2019, p. 616)
\par
``A merge of sensor and fix files by appending sensor records to the fix file's attribute table requires each fix record and its corresponding sensor record to have identical date-timestamps. Records for which fix and sensor timestamps are not identical are typically deleted in this step; the time required to find and fix each mismatch in files of thousands of records is prohibitive. Mismatch of fix and sensor timestamps is a result of longer GPS acquisition times than the programmed 5-min interval. Al- though the fix interval is set to record a GPS location at 5-min intervals, the actual time to acquire a signal and collect a fix can vary from point to point. This can result in fix time slightly different than was recorded in the sensor file, which records data at exactly 5-min intervals'' (Brennan et al., 2019, p. 616)
\par
``Further processing of data within ArcGIS typically includes calculating distance and duration between consecutive fixes using the ``Track Interval to Feature'' function within ArcGIS. The final out- put from the conventional method is a shapefile containing the GPS fixes merged with the sensor records, with site location, distance between fixes, and duration between fixes calculated.'' (Brennan et al., 2019, p. 616)
\par
``The R code discussed in this paper rapidly accomplishes the prepro- cessing of Lotek GPS collar data (as described earlier using Excel and ArcGIS) in a single function titled ``Lotek\_Function'' (Fig. 1). User-defined inputs for the R code include the fix file name, sensor file name, and ani- mal ID. The user may select an additional input of Graze = ``Yes,'' in which case the R code will categorize behavior as either graze (G) or nongraze (NG) based on a classification tree from Augustine and Derner (2013). \\
Both the fix file and sensor file are read into the R environment. For both files, the date-timestamps are converted and standardized to an ``m/d/YYYY H: M: S'' format. The program corrects time differences be- tween fix and sensor records by rounding the GPS fix times down to the nearest 5-min interval to prevent data loss during the merging step. In the output file, the original fix time is maintained for the user's informa- tion. Sensor and fix files are merged into a single data frame on the basis of identical date-timestamps. Lastly, an additional column of Animal ID is created on the basis of user input.'' (Brennan et al., 2019, p. 616)
\par
``Included in the R code workflow are calculations to measure the dis- tance in meters between successive GPS locations based on latitude and longitude coordinates, the bearing, and the duration in time (minutes) be- tween consecutive points. The resulting combined data frame will output as both a .csv file and a shapefile'' (Brennan et al., 2019, p. 616)

\par
``The effective management of grazing animals is an ongoing challenge for producers. The constant drive towards improved animal efficiency and optimal use of available land and resources can be'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 1)
\par
``hindered by vast land areas and limited contact with animals'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 2)
\par
``Virtual fences are defined as boundaries, enclosures, or barriers without a physical barrier [2], and may rely on the animal wearing a device. The animal is typically trained through associative learning of a neutral audio stimulus with a negative or aversive stimulus, normally an electrical stimulus [2]'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 2)
\par
``A patented, automated virtual fencing algorithm that utilises GPS technology and requires the \\
animal to wear a collar device was developed through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial \\
Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia [3,4]'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 2) Does this brand of virtual fence collar still exist?
\par
``If cattle are learning the \\
location of a virtual fence, they may not enter a new area when a fence is moved. However, if they are \\
attentive to the audio cue and have learned its association with the electrical stimulus, they should \\
continue forward into a new zone when they approach an old virtual barrier and do not receive any \\
signals. This latter behaviour is critical to the success of virtual fencing technology, but to date has not \\
been assessed in a paddock setting.'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 2) This is the question we have about work in our study.
\par
``The use of some types of virtual fencing systems have elicited welfare concerns, and may not be practical for countries that currently ban the use of electric shock collars for dogs (e.g., Germany, Switzerland, and Wales; [2]).'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 2)
\par
``ulceration'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 2)
\par
``The on-farm application of this technology, and one of its practical benefits, would typically see fences being shifted to aid in pasture management and enable optimal feed efficiency. \\
Thus, the current study was carried out to assess how heifers within a group would respond to a virtual fence line that was periodically shifted to exclude animals from different portions of an experimental paddock, including quantifying any changes in behavioural activity. It was predicted that cattle would avoid a virtual line by responding to the audio cue, but may also exhibit some location-learning.'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 3)
\par
``For this experiment, cattle were fitted with re-purposed collar straps (from MooMonitors\textregistered, Causeway, County Kerry, Ireland) that included approximately 1.5 kg of hanging counterweights (three counterweights were included with variation between individual weights) and the automated experimental prototype virtual fencing collar device (eShepherdTM, Agersens, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; device weight: 0.80 kg and 19 cm L \texttimes{} 10 cm W \texttimes{} 5 cm H), positioned on the left side of each animal's neck.'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 3)
\par
``A virtual fence boundary (separating inclusion versus exclusion zones), specified using GPS coordinates, is transmitted to the collar using a radio frequency link. If movement was above a specific velocity (unable to be stated due to intellectual property rights), i.e., the animal was trotting/running, the animal was deemed unresponsive to stimuli and thus stimuli were not applied. As the animal reaches the virtual fence boundary (directly on the virtual line), the collar device emits a 2.5 s audio cue (single continuous tone at 785 Hz {$\pm$} 15 Hz, 58 DB). If the animal stands still or turns away, no electrical stimulus is applied. Continuous movement through the virtual fence line elicits an electrical stimulus immediately following the audio cue. For this experiment, an electrical stimulus level of 800 V electrical pulses delivered in less than 1 s was used (precise details are unable to be specified due to intellectual property rights). This sequence of an audio cue followed by the electrical stimulus is repeated if the animal walks through the fence line and continues into the ``exclusion zone'' (the collar has a temporary shut-down feature if multiple stimuli are applied). No stimuli are applied if the animal turns around to walk back out of the exclusion zone.'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 3)
\par
``An IceQube\textregistered{} 1.001 (IceRobotics Ltd., Roslin, Midlothian, Scotland, UK) was fitted to each animal's back left leg to monitor standing, lying, and steps (recorded in 15-min intervals) across the trial duration'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 4)
\par
``Across the trial duration, the batteries on the experimental prototype collars had to be recharged \\
approximately every third day, which involved a removal of the collar.'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 4) That's way way more frequent than VENCE collars which need new batteries every 6 months of so. It makes me think the GPS collection interval was near constant.
\par
``neck lesions'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 4) Caused by the collars- this is what we saw with a few individuals during the webbing style collars.
\par
``All times of battery charging were excluded \\
from all datasetsAnimals 2017, 7, 72'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 5) We should consider removing the days were animals were processed from our datasets.

``The collar log data were compiled to provide the percentage of time each animal spent in the inclusion zone for each different fence The collar log data were compiled to provide the percentage of time each animal spent in the inclusion zone for each different fence location.''

``Across a period of approximately 48 h, as predicted, the cattle learned to appropriately respond to the audio cues alone, minimising the number of electrical stimuli they received. Within approximately 4 h, animals accessed new inclusion zones when fence lines had been moved, thus showing that the animals were learning to respond to the audio cues as an indication of the virtual boundaries rather than showing any predicted learning of the boundary location'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``The practical reality and appeal of virtual fencing technology is that fence lines can be shifted whenever desired. Prior to this study, it was unclear how cattle would respond to moving lines. \\
Location-based learning may lead animals to remain within a specific inclusion zone even after the virtual line has been shifted'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``Further study could assess the learning rates of na\"ive groups of cattle and the potential influences of \\
group hierarchies [18], including whether all individuals need to experience the collar stimuli to be \\
excluded from specific areas.'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 10) Great questions to follow up on
\par
``Additionally, future research should assess the effectiveness of virtual fences dependent \\
on the resources animals are being excluded from and their motivation to access them, such as higher \\
pasture quality being present in the exclusion zone'' (Campbell et al., 2017, p. 11) I.e. the grass is always greener on the other side problem

  abstract = {Management prescriptions for contemporary ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) forests often incorporate the restoration to a structure that more closely resembles pre\textendash European contact forests. Successful restoration programs should incorporate the herbaceous understory component; however, published research specifically addressing changes in understory species composition is minimal. Ponderosa pine influence on the undercanopy environment may be an important factor in understory vegetation distribution. In this study, we addressed the relationships among ponderosa pine abundance, undercanopy environment, and understory species composition and made inferences with respect to restoration potential. Data representing vegetation, soil, and environmental attributes were measured in 28 plots in an eastern Oregon ponderosa pine forest. Relationships among the parameters measured were evaluated using cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, and ordination. Ponderosa pine occupancy was inversely related to understory perennial bunchgrass abundance and species diversity and appeared to regulate the undercanopy habitat through alterations in light intensity, nitrogen availability, and soil temperature. Light availability was the most important ponderosa pine\textendash influenced undercanopy environmental parameter associated with understory vegetation distribution. These data suggested that degradation in the undercanopy environment associated with higher levels of ponderosa pine abundance may be temporary and that restoration practices that reduce pine occupancy should promote undercanopy conditions favorable to perennial bunchgrass growth. However, understory vegetation recovery in stands with excessive pine ingrowth may be constrained by desired understory species loss or invasion by more competitive understory vegetation. Resumen Las recomendaciones de manejo para los bosques contempor\'aneos de pino ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) incorporan a menudo la restauraci\'on de la estructura que se asemeje m\'as a los bosques que hab\'ia antes del contacto por los Europeos. Los programas exitosos de restauraci\'on deber\'ian incorporar el componente herb\'aceo debajo de los \'arboles. Sin embargo, la investigaci\'on publicada que se enfoque espec\'ificamente en los cambios en la composici\'on de las especies debajo de los arboles es m\'inima. La influencia del pino ponderosa en el ambiente debajo de la cubierta puede ser un factor importante en la distribuci\'on de la vegetaci\'on debajo de la cubierta de los arboles. En este estudio vimos las relaciones entre la abundancia del pino ponderosa, el medioambiente debajo de la cubierta de los arboles, y la composici\'on de las especies debajo de la cubierta. Asimismo, se hicieron inferencias con respecto al potencial de restauraci\'on. Los datos representan vegetaci\'on, suelo, y los atributos del medio ambiente que se midieron en 28 parcelas en el bosque de pino ponderosa, en el oeste de Oreg\'on. Las relaciones entre los par\'ametros medidos fueron evaluadas usando an\'alisis cluster, an\'alisis de las especies del indicador, as\'i como la ordenaci\'on. La presencia del pino ponderosa fue inversamente relacionada con la abundancia de las gram\'ineas perenes amacolladas y con la diversidad de las especies y parece que regula el h\'abitat debajo de la cubierta de los arboles a trav\'es de la las alteraciones de la intensidad de la luz, disponibilidad de nitr\'ogeno, y la temperatura del suelo. La disponibilidad de la luz fue el factor m\'as importante en el pino ponderosa que influencia los par\'ametros del medio ambiente debajo de la cubierta asociados con la distribuci\'on de la vegetaci\'on debajo de la cubierta de los arboles. Estos datos sugieren que la degradaci\'on en el medio ambiente debajo de la cubierta de los arboles asociada con niveles m\'as altos de la abundancia del pino ponderosa quiz\'a sea temporal y que la pr\'actica de restauraci\'on que reduce la presencia del pino debe promover las condiciones favorables debajo de la cubierta para el crecimiento de gram\'ineas perenes amacolladas. Sin embargo, la recuperaci\'on de la vegetaci\'on en grupos con un excesivo crecimiento del pino se puede forzar por la p\'erdida o la invasi\'on de vegetaci\'on m\'as competitiva.},

Evaluation of resilience is hampered by the short history of logging, lack of long-term experiments and methodological limitations. To test the effect of clearcut logging, prescribed burning and reforestation on forest resilience, we recorded vascular plant cover repeatedly after treatment between 1981 and 2008 in 16 permanent research installations in three biogeoclimatic zones: Engelmann Spruce- Subalpine Fir, Interior Cedar-Hemlock and Sub-Boreal Spruce. We created a plant-trait dataset for the 181 recorded species to define plant functional types representing groups of plants that behave in similar ways and/or produce similar ecological outcomes. These plant functional types, along with taxonomic analysis of diagnostic and indicator species, were then used to evaluate plant community response to disturbance. Twenty years post-treatment, species diversity increased in all zones and plant abundance was greatest in the Interior Cedar-Hemlock. Cover of understory plant functional types associated with mature conifer forests increased in all zones, constituting a significant proportion ({$>$} 40\%) of the vegetation community by year 20. Response patterns varied by zone and with time. Understory species diagnostic of mature forests were present in all zones by year 20, but we identified indicator species sensitive to slashburning or requiring more time for recovery, including white-flowered rhododendron (Rhododendron albiflorum) and devil's club (Oplopanax horridus). Overall, loss of compositional or functional diversity following harvest and site remediation was not detected, suggesting that montane and subalpine forests in British Columbia are resilient to this treatment. However, because these forests can be slow to recover from disturbance, the post-disturbance assessment window of this study may not have been long enough to detect diminishment of ecosystem resilience.},

However, in the past these challenges were hardly considered, but in more recent times they have been increasingly considered by various faculties and graduate schools due to the expanding needs from growing enrolments. To further develop and strengthen the responses to these identified needs, this article reviews literature concerning challenges faced by beginning educational researchers in conducting literature review, aiming to help unpack this complicated phenomenon by constructing a coherent story. Based on our review, we propose a framework to conceptualize four types of challenges. We term them LMCO (linguistic, methodological, conceptual, and ontological) challenges. Discussions centers on the four identified challenges, recommendations for future studies and implications to graduate preparatory programs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little epidemiological information exists on overuse injuries in elite road cyclists. Anecdotal reports indicate anterior knee pain and lower back pain may be common problems. PURPOSE: This study was conducted to register overuse injuries among professional road cyclists with special focus on anterior knee and lower back pain. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: We attended training camps of 7 professional teams and interviewed 109 of 116 cyclists (94\%) on overuse injuries they had experienced in the previous 12 months. Injuries that required attention from medical personnel or involved time loss from cycling were registered. Additional information on anterior knee pain and lower back pain was collected using specific questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 94 injuries were registered; 45\% were in the lower back and 23\% in the knee. Twenty-three time-loss injuries were registered-57\% in the knee, 22\% in the lower back, and 13\% in the lower leg. Fifty-eight percent of all cyclists had experienced lower back pain in the previous 12 months, and 41\% of all cyclists had sought medical attention for it. Thirty-six percent had experienced anterior knee pain and 19\% had sought medical attention for it. Few cyclists had missed competitions because of pain in the lower back (6\%) or anterior knee (9\%). CONCLUSION: Lower back pain and anterior knee pain were the most prevalent overuse injuries, with knee injuries most likely to cause time loss and lower back pain causing the highest rates of functional impairment and medical attention. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Future efforts to prevent overuse injuries in competitive cyclists should focus on lower back pain and anterior knee pain.},

  abstract = {Stubble height, a measure of the herbaceous vegetation remaining after grazing, has been widely used in recent years to gage the impacts of grazing use in riparian areas. Stubble height is a short-term management guide that should only be applied to help attain long-term ecological objectives; it should not be thought of as a long-term management objective. Maintaining a minimum stubble height helps preserve forage plant vigor, retain sufficient forage to reduce cattle browsing of willows (Salix spp.), stabilize sediments, indirectly limit stream-bank trampling, maintain cattle gains, and provide an easily communicated management criterion. Based on limited specific research of riparian system response and on knowledge of the characteristics of how cattle graze, a 10-cm residual stubble height is recommended by the authors as a starting point for improved riparian grazing management. Monitoring should then be conducted to determine if an adjustment is needed. In some situations, 7 cm or even less stubble height may provide for adequate riparian ecosystem function, particularly when stream-banks are dry and stable or possibly at high elevations where vegetation is naturally of low stature. In other situations, 15-20 cm of stubble height may be required to reduce browsing of willows or limit trampling impact to vulnerable streambanks. The recommended criterion would apply to streamside and nearby meadow sites with hydrophilic or potentially hydrophilic vegetation, but not directly to dry meadows or even to all wet meadows. Stubble height may have little application where the stream-banks are stabilized by coarse substrates, or the channels are deeply incised. The effects of residual stubble height in riparian functions have received limited direct experimental examination. Consequently, much of the information in this review was derived from studies indirectly related to the questions raised and, to some extent, from observations of experienced professionals. The authors have identified areas of scientific investigation needed to improve our understanding of the effects of stubble height on riparian function and grazing management. /// La altura del rastrojo, una medida de la vegetaci\'on herb-cea remanente despu\'es de que ha sido sujeta apacentamiento, ha sido ampliamente utilizada en a\~nos recientes para medir el impacto del apacentamiento en las \'aeas ribere\~nas. La altura del rastrojo es una gu\'aa de manejo a corto plazo que debe ser aplicada solo para ayudar a lograr los objetivos ecol\'ogicos de largo plazo y no debe ser tomada como un objetivo de manejo a largo plazo.

  abstract = {Cattle graze seasonally on national forests in the Western United States, and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and/or elk (Cervus elaphus) are sympatric with cattle in most of these areas. But the effects of interspecific interactions in terms of both the resources selected and animal distributions across landscapes are poorly understood. At the USDA Forest Service Starkey Experimental Forest and Range (Starkey), located in northeast Oregon, USA, elk and mule deer were free ranging within a 78 km2 study area enclosed by a 2.4 m high fence while cattle were moved among pastures in summer on a deferred-rotation schedule. Elk, mule deer, and cattle were located with an automated telemetry system from 1993-1996 and locations linked to a geographic information system (GIS) of Starkey. Our objective was to examine responses of elk and mule deer to cattle at multiple spatial and temporal levels. We compared elk and mule deer distributions, use of plant communities, and resource selection functions in one cattle pasture (24 km2) during early summer (cattle present in odd-numbered years) and late summer (cattle present in even-numbered years). Elk and deer differed in their spatial and temporal responses to presence of cattle. When cattle were present, the proportion of elk locations within the pasture decreased and use of the ponderosa pine/Douglas fir (Pinus ponderosa/Pseudotsuga menziesii) plant community within the pasture decreased in early summer and increased in late summer. The cattle resource selection function variable for early summer was not a predictor of elk distributions when cattle were present, but it was a predictor on years when cattle were absent. In late summer, the cattle resource selection function variable was a predictor of elk distributions regardless of presence of cattle. For mule deer distributions the cattle resource selection function variable was not a significant predictor in early summer (cattle present or absent). or in late summer when cattle were present, but it was a negative predictor of mule deer distributions when cattle were absent in late summer. Mule deer use increased or decreased in opposite direction from elk use in 3 of 4 season/year combinations for both pasture and ponderosa pine/Douglas fir. Our results suggest that competition for forage could occur between elk and cattle in late summer and that species interactions may be stronger between elk and cattle than mule deer and cattle. We recommend that managers look closely at stocking levels in late summer because cattle and elk use some of the same resources during that period, and to pay particular attention to the ponderosa pine/Douglas fir plant community where we found significant interactions between cattle and elk.},

To mitigate human-wildlife conflicts, spatial zonation schemes can be implemented to separate human activities from key wildlife habitats, e.g., by designating undisturbed wildlife refuges or areas with some level of restriction to human recreation and land use. However, mitigation practice rarely considers temporal differences in human-wildlife interactions. We used GPS telemetry data from 15 red deer to study the seasonal (winter vs. summer) and diurnal (day vs. night) variation in recreation effects on habitat use in a study region in south-western Germany where a spatial zonation scheme has been established. Our study aimed to determine if recreation infrastructure and spatial zonation affected red deer habitat use and whether these effects varied daily or seasonally. Recreation infrastructure did not affect home range selection in the study area, but strongly determined habitat use within the home range. The spatial zonation scheme was reflected in both of these two levels of habitat selection, with refuges and core areas being more frequently used than the border zones. Habitat use differed significantly between day and night in both seasons. Both summer and winter recreation trails, and nearby foraging habitats, were avoided during day, whereas a positive association was found during night. We conclude that human recreation has an effect on red deer habitat use, and when designing mitigation measures daily and seasonal variation in human-wildlife interactions should be taken into account. We advocate using spatial zonation in conjunction with temporal restrictions (i.e., banning nocturnal recreation activities) and the creation of suitable foraging habitats away from recreation trails.},

These proceedings contain the reviewed papers from the 4th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming. The papers reflect the wide range of disciplines that impinge upon precision livestock farming including feeding dairy, data quality, poultry and pig applications, livestock environment, wireless sensing, dairy fertility and calving management, animal identification, mastitis detection and locomotion. The broad range of research topics reported are a valuable resource for researchers, advisors, teachers and professionals in agriculture. Also note that the reviewed papers from the 7th European Conference on Precision Agriculture are presented in a companion publication.},

However, recent studies have stressed the greater importance of increased high intensity rainfall. Additional perspective is provided by an examination of livestock numbers in the upper Rio Grande region of New Mexico during the 19th century, particularly during the Mexican period when the ranges were heavily stocked with sheep (possibly 3,000,000 head in the 1820's), but with little or no gullying. The incomplete record of livestock numbers in relation to climate and gullying backs up the climatic argument but also gives some new support to the older view that overgrazing was a major contributive factor causing severe modern gullying.},

  abstract = {1 Range management is based on the response of plant species and communities to grazing intensity. The identification of easily measured plant functional traits that consistently predict grazing response in a wide spectrum of rangelands would be a major advance. 2 Sets of species from temperate subhumid upland grasslands of Argentina and Israel, grazed by cattle, were analysed to find out whether: (i) plants with contrasting grazing responses differed in terms of easily measured vegetative and life-history traits; (ii) their grazing response could be predicted from those traits; (iii) these patterns differed between the two countries. Leaf mass, area, specific area (SLA) and toughness were measured on 83 Argentine and 19 Israeli species. Species were classified by grazing response (grazing-susceptible or grazing-resistant) and plant height ({$<$} or {$>$} 40 cm) as well as by life history (annual or perennial) and taxonomy (monocotyledon or dicotyledon). 3 Similar plant traits were associated with a specific response to grazing in both Argentina and Israel. Grazing-resistant species were shorter in height, and had smaller, more tender, leaves, with higher SLA than grazing-susceptible species. Grazing resistance was associated with both avoidance traits (small height and leaf size) and tolerance traits (high SLA). Leaf toughness did not contribute to grazing resistance and may be related to selection for canopy dominance. 4 Plant height was the best single predictor of grazing response, followed by leaf mass. The best prediction of species grazing response was achieved by combining plant height, life history and leaf mass. SLA was a comparatively poor predictor of grazing response. 5 The ranges of plant traits, and some correlation patterns between them, differed markedly between species sets from Argentina and Israel. However, the significant relationships between plant traits and grazing response were maintained. 6 The results of this exploratory study suggest that prediction of grazing responses on the basis of easily measured plant traits is feasible and consistent between similar grazing systems in different regions. The results challenge the precept that intense cattle grazing necessarily favours species with tough, unpalatable, leaves.},

Modifications to Roosevelt Dam, completed in 1996, raised the height of the dam and resulted in a high probability of willow flycatcher habitat inundation within the reservoir's conservation pool. We collected habitat measurements and monitored 922 willow flycatcher nests from 1996 to 2006 to investigate effects of inundation on willow flycatcher habitat and subsequent changes in nest success, productivity, and distribution. Inundation of willow flycatcher habitat at Roosevelt Lake occurred in 2005, changing the location and amount of suitable breeding habitat and significantly altering habitat structure (e.g., thinner vegetation, more canopy gaps) of formally occupied nest sites. The willow flycatcher population at Roosevelt Lake decreased 47\% from 209 territories in 2004 to 111 territories in 2006 in response to habitat changes. Willow flycatchers made fewer nesting attempts and nest success rates were significantly lower during inundation (2005 and 2006: 45\%) than preinundation (1996-2004: 57\%). Combined, these factors negatively affected the population's productivity during inundation. Although inundation caused extensive vegetation die-off, we did observe regeneration of vegetation in some areas at Roosevelt Lake in 2006. The Roosevelt Lake population remains one of the largest willow flycatcher populations in the state and territory numbers remain high enough that the population may not suffer long-term effects if sufficient suitable habitat continues to exist during the cycle of inundation and regeneration. Reservoir managers may be able to develop dam management guidelines that reduce damage to habitat, encourage habitat growth, and mimic the dynamic nature of unaltered riparian habitat. These guidelines can be implemented, as appropriate, at reservoirs throughout the willow flycatcher's range.]},

Available evidence suggests a threshold amount of habitat loss at which the probability of population extinction increases from near-zero to near-one following a small additional loss of habitat. The main factors thought to determine this extinction threshold are reproductive rate of the organism, rate of emigration of the organism from habitat, habitat pattern in the landscape (fragmentation), and matrix quality (survival rate of the organism in non-habitat areas). Effective conservation measures require knowledge not only of what factors determine the threshold, but also the relative magnitudes of their effects. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the relative effects of these four factors on the extinction threshold, using a spatially-explicit simulation model. Reproductive rate had the largest potential effect on the extinction threshold. The rate of emigration from habitat also had a very strong predicted effect on the extinction threshold; the higher the rate of emigration, the more habitat was needed for persistence. Matrix quality had a moderate effect, and habitat pattern had a very small predicted effect. The simulations predicted that under certain circumstances up to 58\% less habitat is required for population persistence, if a matrix of very low quality is converted to a matrix of very high quality. Matrix quality can be improved by maintaining heterogeneous landscapes with a diversity of vegetated features, and by reducing factors causing direct mortality of dispersers such as road traffic and pesticides. In summary, the simulations suggest that (i) the first priority for conservation should be habitat preservation and restoration, (ii) information on movement rates of organisms is critical for predicting extinction thresholds and (iii) conservation strategies should consider the quality of the whole landscape, including the matrix.},

  abstract = {(1) Cover is among the most widely used measures of abundance of plant species because it is not biased by the size or distribution of individuals. This study compared cover estimates obtained by line interception, point interception, and cover-class estimation from 136 sample lines located systematically in sagebrush steppe in western U.S.A. (2) Line interception estimates of shrub cover were significantly higher than those obtained by point interception; estimates of `bare ground and litter' by point interception were higher than those of line interception by the same amount. These offsetting differences resulted from the assumption, used in line interception sampling, that shrubs completely cover the areas within the outlines of their canopies. Otherwise, point interception and line interception estimates were very similar. (3) Cover-class estimation provided reliable estimates only for the dominant shrub species. Typically, estimates for grasses and other species with small or rare individuals were high in comparison with the other techniques. This is a consequence of the assumption that cover values are uniformly distributed about the mid-points of the cover classes. (4) Point interception achieved about the same degree of precision as line interception in one-third less sampling time. Point interception is the most efficient of the three methods where estimates for most of the species in a community are needed. (5) Optimal combinations of numbers of lines and numbers of sample units per line in relation to the time involved for a particular level of precision were investigated. In general, increased precision was achieved by sampling more lines rather than more sample units per line.},

``Line interception (Canfield 1941) has firm theoretical backing, provided that the line is a true geometric line of zero width (Lucas \& Seber 1977; DeVries 1979). The length of a line intercepted by a species divided by the total length of line sampled estimates the proportion of the area covered by that species.'' (Floyd and Anderson, 1987, p. 221)
\par
``Point interception involves recording the entities that intercept vertical or inclined projections of a number of points established on the area being sampled. The method has a simple theoretical basis (Goodall 1952; GreigSmith 1983) and the proportion of points intercepted equals the cover of that species.'' (Floyd and Anderson, 1987, p. 221)
\par
``Quadrat techniques range from the precise mapping of individual plants to rough estimation by cover classes, such as the canopy-coverage method (Daubenmire 1959) or'' (Floyd and Anderson, 1987, p. 221)
\par
``Braun-Blanquet's (1965) cover-abundance scale.'' (Floyd and Anderson, 1987, p. 222)
\par
``Cover estimates among methods were compared for each transect and for the entire area, using the estimate for a 20-m line as the sample unit. A blocked analysis of variance, with the 20-m lines as blocks and the methods as treatments, comprised each comparison. If the analysis of variance revealed a significant difference at P= 0 1, a Student-NewmanKeuls multiple range test (P=0 05) was used to confirm and locate the differences. Because P=0-05 represented the 'experimentwise error rate', the use of a larger probability (P= 0 1) in the analysis of variance reduced the chance of making a type II error (Zar 1974).'' (Floyd and Anderson, 1987, p. 222) Interesting...I will have to look into blocked ANOVA
\par
``estimates of cover by line interception were significantly higher than those obtained by the other two methods for all shrubs combined and for three shrub species (Table 1).'' (Floyd and Anderson, 1987, p. 223)
\par
``Cumulative confidence limits for total shrub cover show that the same precision is obtained by point interception with about half as many metres of sampling as with line interception (Fig. 1)'' (Floyd and Anderson, 1987, p. 224)
\par
``terception; thus point interception achieved the same level of precision as line interception in about two-thirds of the sampling time.'' (Floyd and Anderson, 1987, p. 224)
\par
``The vast majority of the discrepancies among the three techniques resulted from differences between canopy-coverage estimation and one or both of the other two techniques'' (Floyd and Anderson, 1987, p. 226) canopy-coverage = Daubenmire
\par
``In such a case, cover will be over-estimated by canopy coverage because it is assumed that the actual cover values are uniformly distributed about the midpoints of each cover-class (Fig. 3). In reality, there are far more values in the lower half of each class. The smaller the true mean of the population, the greater the over-estimation'' (Floyd and Anderson, 1987, p. 226)
\par
``efficient than line interception, but he compared the time required to examine forty quadrats for canopy-coverage estimation with that required to examine 350 m of line interception. He assumed, based on the recommendations of Canfield (1941), that approximately 350 m of line interception data were required to adequately describe the vegetation.'' (Floyd and Anderson, 1987, p. 227)},

  abstract = {This article examines the question of how well the rangeland management profession has served conservation of patterns and processes that support multiple ecosystem services. We examine the paradigms under which rangeland management operates and argue that our profession developed under the utilitarian paradigm with the primary goals of sustainable forage for livestock production. While optimization of multiple rangeland products and services has always been a consideration, a comprehensive set of principles have not be been developed to advance this concept. We argue that fire and grazing, often viewed as mere tools used for production goals, should rather be viewed as essential ecosystem processes. Rangeland management continues to operate under the utilitarian paradigm appropriate to societal values of the 20th century and by and large has failed to provide management guidance to reverse degradation of several highly valued ecosystem services. We support this argument with evidence that biodiversity has declined on rangelands in the past half century and that much of this decline is due to management goals that favor a narrow suite of species. The full suite of ecosystem services valued by society will only benefit by management for heterogeneity, which implies that there is no one goal for management and that landscape-level planning is crucial. Explicitly incorporating heterogeneity into state-and-transition models is an important advancement not yet achieved by our profession. We present new principles for rangeland management formed on the basis of conservation of pattern and process. While recognizing that many rangelands have significant deviations from historic plant communities and disturbance regimes, we suggest that management for conservation of pattern and process should focus on fire and grazing to the extent possible to promote a shifting mosaic across large landscapes that include patches that are highly variable in the amount of disturbance rather than the current goal of uniform moderate disturbance. Resumen Este art\'iculo examina la pregunta de que tan bien los profesionales en manejo de pastizales han aplicado los patrones y procesos en la conservaci\'on de los servicios multiples que proveen los ecosistemas. Examinamos los paradigmas bajo los cuales opera el manejo de pastizales y discutimos el desarrollo de nuestra profesi\'on bajo el paradigma utilitario con el principal objetivo de sustentabilidad forrajera para la producci\'on de ganado. Mientras que la optimizaci\'on de los m\'ultiples productos y servicios de los pastizales han sido consideradas un paquete completo de principios no ha sido desarrollado para avanzar en este concepto. Discutimos que el fuego y el pastoreo a veces son vistos como simples herramientas usadas para objetivos de producci\'on cuando deber\'ian ser vistas como partes esenciales de los procesos del ecosistema. El manejo de pastizales contin\'ua operando bajo el paradigma utilitario t\'ipico de los valores sociales del siglo XX y por mucho ha fallado en proveer directrices de manejo para revertir la degradaci\'on de varios servicios valiosos de los ecosistemas. Apoyamos este argumento con evidencia de que la biodiversidad ha deca\'ido en los pastizales en la mitad del siglo pasado y mucho de esta disminuci\'on se debe a los objetivos de manejo que favorecen a un reducido n\'umero de especies. El juego completo de servicios valuados por la sociedad solo beneficiara con el manejo por heterogeneidad el cual implica que no hay un objetivo para el manejo y que la planeaci\'on a nivel paisaje es crucial. Incorporando de manera expl\'icita modelos de estado y transici\'on es un avance importante que no ha sido logrado por nuestra profesi\'on. Presentamos nuevos principios para el manejo de pastizales desarrollados en base a procesos y patrones de conservaci\'on. Mientras reconozcamos que muchos pastizales tienen desviaciones significativas de hist\'oricas comunidades de plantas y reg\'imenes de disturbio, sugerimos que el manejo por conservaci\'on de patrones y procesos deber\'a enfocarse en fuego y pastoreo en medida de lo posible para promover el cambio en un mosaico a trav\'es de grandes paisajes que incluyen parches que son altamente variables en la magnitud de disturbio en lugar de objetivos actuales de disturbio uniforme y moderado.},

  abstract = {Public lands occupied by feral horses in North America are frequently managed for multiple uses with land use conflict occurring among feral horses, livestock, wildlife, and native grassland conservation. The factors affecting habitat use by horses is critical to understand where conflict may be greatest. We related horse presence and abundance to landscape attributes in a GIS to examine habitat preferences using 98 field plots sampled within a portion of the Rocky Mountain Forest Reserve of SW Alberta, Canada. Horse abundance was greatest in grassland and cut block habitats, and lowest in conifer and mixedwood forest. Resource selection probability functions and count models of faecal abundance indicated that horses preferred areas closer to water, with reduced topographic ruggedness, situated farther from forests, and located farther away from primary roads and trails frequented by recreationalists, but closer to small linear features (i.e. cut lines) that may be used as beneficial travel corridors. Horse presence and abundance were closely related to cattle presence during summer, suggesting that both herbivores utilise the same habitats. Estimates of forage biomass removal (44~\%) by mid-July were near maximum acceptable levels. In contrast to horse-cattle associations, horses were negatively associated with wild ungulate abundance, although the mechanism behind this remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Our results indicate that feral horses in SW Alberta exhibit complex habitat selection patterns during spring and summer, including overlap in use with livestock. This finding highlights the need to assess and manage herbivore populations consistent with rangeland carrying capacity and the maintenance of range health.},

  abstract = {Previous work on the US Atlantic coast has generally shown that coastal foredunes are dominated by two dune grass species, Ammophila breviligulata (American beachgrass) and Uniola paniculata (sea oats). From Virginia northward, A. breviligulata dominates, while U. paniculata is the dominant grass south of Virginia. Previous work suggests that these grasses influence the shape of coastal foredunes in species-specific ways, and that they respond differently to environmental stressors; thus, it is important to know which species dominates a given dune system. The range boundaries of these two species remains unclear given the lack of comprehensive surveys. In an attempt to determine these boundaries, we conducted a literature survey of 98 studies that either stated the range limits and/or included field-based studies/observations of the two grass species. We then produced an interactive map that summarizes the locations of the surveyed papers and books. The literature review suggests that the current southern range limit for A. breviligulata is Cape Fear, NC, and the northern range limit for U. paniculata is Assateague Island, on the Maryland and Virginia border. Our data suggest a northward expansion of U. paniculata, possibly associated with warming trends observed near the northern range limit in Painter, VA. In contrast, the data regarding a range shift for A. breviligulata remain inconclusive. We also compare our literature-based map with geolocated records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and iNaturalist research grade crowd-sourced observations. We intend for our literature-based map to aid coastal researchers who are interested in the dynamics of these two species and the potential for their ranges to shift as a result of climate change.},

However, the disadvantages of conventional and electric fencing include material and labor costs and increased manual labor. Virtual fencing has been developed and evaluated for almost two decades. The evolution of precision livestock farming, specifically virtual fencing, presents new opportunities for maximizing the utilization of available pasture land. Virtual fencing technology decreases the labor involved in physical fencing, provides greater adaptability to changes in pasture conditions, increases precision and efficiency, and offers additional flexibility in grazing management practices. However, that innovative technology should be further developed, and improvements should include decreasing the total costs of the system and increasing its application to other technological groups of ruminants, e.g., suckler cows with calves, increasing the efficiency of the system operation in large areas and a larger number of animals. Recent advancements in electronic communication and device (i.e., collar) design hold the potential to significantly enhance the effectiveness of the technology while also reducing costs. However, it is necessary to conduct a further evaluation to determine their utility in precision agricultural systems. This review paper aims to present an innovative concept of virtual fencing technology for pastures, compare currently available systems of this type, and indicate areas where further research and development should be carried out using Internet of Things (IoT) systems.},

``coding spatial pyra- mid matching (ScSPM) with a linear support vector machine was used by Yu et al. [3] to recognize 18 species of animals, reaching 82\% of accuracy on their own dataset'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 748)
\par
``As input to the ScSPM the photo-trap images were preprocessed by removing empty frames (images without animals), manually cropping all the animals from the images, and selecting only those images that capture the ani- mals' whole body without distortions or noise. This procedure gave Yu et al. \\
high performance but in unrealistic conditions.'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 748)
\par
``A deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) was used by Chen et al. [4] to classify 20 animal species in their own dataset. An important difference from [3] is that they use an automatic segmentation method (Ensemble Video Object Cut) for cropping the animals from the images and use this crops to train and test their system. Although this is a realistic classification scenario the classification model is too weak to capture class variability. Also the automatic segmentation algorithm gave Chen et al. a lot of empty images which give them a 38.31\% of accuracy.'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 748)
\par
``Very deep ConvNets were used by Gomez et al. [5] to classify 26 animal species in the Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Multiple versions of training and test- ing samples as unbalanced samples, empty frames, incomplete animal images,'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 748)
\par
``cropped animals and objects too far from focal distance were used. A compari- son using the Chen et al. dataset showed that deeper architectures outperform shallow ones in the same dataset. Although the performance of the models of Gomez et al. showed high values in the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, said model performance in Chen et al.'s dataset was less than 60\% due to a high-noisy training set. This fact reveals a lack of confidence in low quality camera-trap images.'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 749)
\par
``First (Job 1), all the images \\
without animals (false positive) are removed'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 749) We do the same thing using IrFanView
\par
``First and most common problem is partial capture of the animal (see Fig. 2(b)). This problem can confuse any automatic algorithm that learned a class appearance based in an specific feature (like head attributes or legs shape) even biologist are unable to identify some images in this condition'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 750)
\par
``Background occlusion is a common feature of camera-trap images in jungle or dense forest. \\
Unlike Snapshot Serengeti dateset where African savannah makes difficult to occlude any animal in jungle or forest is very common. Although camera-traps must be set in a clean region plants grown or animals continuously enter and exit from vegetation zones. Occlusion has the same effect of partial images and additionally introduces a lot of noise in the animal body regions.'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 750)
\par
``Auto-oclussion (see Fig. 2(d)) has the same effect of partial images, complex poses that hides main features of the species are commonly found in camera-trap images'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 750)
\par
``Low resolution images (see Fig. 2(e)) can be consequence of hardware selection or animal behaviour. High resolution cameras can be used but as result less cameras can be acquired. Even if the camera has high resolution animals do not always walk near the camera as is expected or the scene is too deep as African savannah. Low resolution images can make animal undistinguishable even for a human expert'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 750)
\par
``Blurred animals (see Fig. 2(f)) are also consequence of hardware and animal behaviour unlikely partial images do not hide animal features but reduce the confidence of classification. Overexposed animal images (see Fig. 2(g)) occurs when the animal is too near of camera flash this effect can erase completely distinctive skin patterns of the animal body'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 750)
\par
``Finally, occlusion of the camera lens (see Fig. 2(h)) by water from the environmental conditions can contaminate a large set of images and introduces partial images, occluded images and even blurred sections.'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 750)
\par
``In camera-trap framework biologist have a lot of responsibility in species classifi- \\
cation task, since some species are very unlikely to appear on image (like jaguar \\
in Colombian camera-traps). If one of this scarce species are omitted the whole \\
region study is wrong, since this species are in extinction danger or gives a lot of \\

(Gomez et al., 2016, p. 750) The 8 things that can affect camera trap image quality are:\\
1. Partial capture of the animal\\
2. Background occlusion\\
3. Auto-occlusion\\
4. Low Resolution Images\\
5. Blurred Images- interaction of hardware and animal behavior\\
6. Over-exposed images- animal too near flash\\
7. Occlusion of camera lens

``A multinomial logistic regression gives a probability of membership to each class computed. When a new sample is processed if the probability of mem- bership to each class is very similar the classifier, actually the model is more likely to assign it to an incorrect class [6]. In this situation is more secure to let a human expert to classify the sample.'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 750)
\par
``conf idence =| log10(P robA/P robB) |'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 751)
\par
``The confidence of a classification is computed using Eq. 1. Where P robA is the probability of membership to class one and P robB is the probability of mem- bership to class two. If the confidence of a classification is less that a threshold level called alleviation this classification is passed to a human expert.'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 751)
\par
``Convolutional neural networks [8] consist of stacked convolutional and pooling layers ending in a fully connected layer with a feature vector as Fig. 3 shows as output. Convolutional layers generate feature maps followed by a non-linear acti- vation function. Pooling layers provides scale invariant capacity to the extracted features. A common topology in a ConvNet consists of many sequential stacked convolutional and pooling layers that can extract discriminative features from an input image.'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 751)
\par
``A transformation that maps from low level to high level features is done in a ConvNet. The first layers contain low level features (e.g., edges and orientation) and the last layers contain high level representation features, such as wrinkles, or in the case of animals, the fur details and its discriminative patterns. An important issue in ConvNets architectures is the Depth, reason why community attempts to boost topology Depth. In this work AlexNet [9], VGGNet [10], GoogLenet [11], and ResNets [12] are used in order to probe how Depth in ConvNets impacts in camera trapping species recognition.'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 751)
\par
``In this work two experiments proposed by biologist are done. First, a separation between birds and other animals is done, since camera- trap framework is not designed for birds, however, birds appear on scene and activate camera sensors. This filter is the first step to alleviate the experts' work. Once all the birds are removed from the set the second experiment classify between two mammals sets'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 752)
\par
``Since the used dataset is too small and unbalanced \\
for a successful supervised training, a data augmentation strategy was used. The \\
training set in both experiments was augmented using images from the ImageNet \\
dataset.'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 752) Authors added additional pre-classified images to boost their algorithm.
\par
``Since data augmentation puts a lot of the ImageNet images in the \\
training set, a fine-tuning procedure did not have a significant effect on the \\
system's performance, hence, just the multi-class logistic classifier at the end \\
of the network was trained and the ConvNet was used as black box feature \\
extractor. This work uses multiple very deep ConvNets in order to probe how \\
the Depth in ConvNets impacts on the camera-trapping classification problem \\
in low quality images.'' (Gomez et al., 2016, p. 753) What does this mean?

  abstract = {The area dominated by the shrubs creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) and mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) in the American southwest has increased several-fold over the last century, with a corresponding decrease in areal coverage of productive grasslands and increased surface soil erosion throughout the region. The factors thought to be responsible for this regional shift in vegetation are: (1) overgrazing by domestic livestock; (2) fire suppression; and (3) historical changes in climate. We examine the evidence concerning each of these factors and develop a synthetic model outlining the principles affecting shrubland encroachment, which focuses on life history characteristics of the dominant shrubs and a number of positive biotic and edaphic feedback mechanisms contributing to their establishment and persistence. We conclude that the expansion of shrub dominance that has occurred over the last century may have been triggered by extreme live-stock overgrazing at the end of the nineteenth century, which coincided with rainfall regimes that were unfavorable for perennial grass growth. Hence, the landscape we observe today may be a product of positive feedback mechanisms triggered over a century ago by management practices that were uninformed with regard to the importance of historical climate patterns and the life history characteristics of important rangeland species. Our consideration of these issues also addresses potential land surface - climate interactions that could occur as a result of regional alterations in vegetation dominance and physiognomy.},

\item Okay: They need to be isolated, whatever this means in detail.

\item Not so clear: They have to fulfill common features. Features in general seem to change over time, so we have to point out what the most common features are.

The grazing system was designed to promote biologically acceptable levels of forage use on the half of the allotment scheduled for cattle grazing and to rest the other half by attracting elk to pastures recently grazed by cattle. The objectives of our 2-year study were to determine whether the grazing system facilitated proper forage use as defined by recent forage use and residual stubble height guidelines (i.e., 30 to 40\% use and an 8- to 10-cm stubble height) and whether the system rested one half of the allotment from elk and cattle grazing. Mean (+/- SEM) total elk and cattle forage use for western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii Rydb.), the key forage species, was 32 and 61\% +/- 7 in 1997 and 1998, respectively; corresponding mean (+/- SEM) stubble heights were 11 and 10 cm +/- 0.6. Mean total cattle and elk forage use in 1998 (61\%) exceeded the 30 to 40\% use guidelines. However, mean end-of-year stubble height was never below 10 cm. The grazing system did not provide half the allotment with complete rest; elk used all study pastures. Elk use was higher in pastures with heavier tree cover and steeper terrain in both years, regardless of where cattle grazing occurred. Elk grazing patterns were apparently more dependent on tree cover and topography than any changes in forage caused by the grazing system.},

  abstract = {Naturnahe Gr\"unlandfl\"achen, die zu einer weiten Bandbreite an \"Okosystemleistungen beitragen, wie zum Beispiel Bodenerosionsschutz, Wasserr\"uckhalt und Kohlenstoffspeicherung sind sowohl durch die Intensivierung als auch die komplette Extensivierung stark bedroht. Die Entstehung dieser offenen Landschaften ist untrennbar mit Weidevieh verbunden, welches in Europa noch bis ins 19. Jahrhundert gr\"o\ss tenteils auf Allmenden von Hirten geh\"utet wurde. Der immense Bedarf an Arbeitskr\"aften f\"ur diese Form der Weidehaltung wurde unter anderem auf H\"utekinderm\"arkten gedeckt. Durch die Vereinfachung des Zaunbaus mit Erfindung des Stacheldrahts 1873 und des Elektrozauns 1937, dem Wegfall der Allmende, den verbesserten M\"oglichkeiten zur Futterkonservierung und dem zunehmenden Mangel an Hirten, wurde immer mehr Weideland umz\"aunt. Die Hauptaufgabe des Hirten - die kontinuierliche \"Uberwachung des Weideviehs und der Grasnarbe - konnte jedoch nicht von Z\"aunen \"ubernommen werden. Um erfolgreiche Weidehaltung betreiben zu k\"onnen, kommt es in hohem Ma\ss e auf die optimale r\"aumliche und zeitliche Allokation der Weidetiere bei gleichzeitiger Ber\"ucksichtigung der Grasnarbe an. Das weidende Tier beeinflusst die Grasnarbe genauso wie die Grasnarbe das weidende Tier. Die fehlende Ber\"ucksichtigung dieser Beziehung in der Weidehaltung f\"uhrt dazu, dass vor allem in ariden Gebieten durch \"Uberweidung naturnahe Gr\"unlandfl\"achen gesch\"adigt werden, w\"ahrend auf der anderen Seite die Aufgabe der Weidehaltung zu nat\"urlicher Sukzession und damit zur Verbuschung der vormals offenen Landschaft f\"uhrt.   Im Bereich der Weidehaltung ist es seit der Erfindung des Elektrozauns nicht wirklich zu Neuentwicklungen gekommen, die eine bessere r\"aumliche und zeitliche Allokation der Weidetiere auf der Grasnarbe, h\"atten l\"osen k\"onnen.  Die Entwicklung des GPS-basierten virtuellen Z\"aunens, bei dem jedes erwachsene Tier ein spezielles GPS-Halsband tr\"agt und die Weidezuteilung \"uber ein mobiles Endger\"at stattfindet, scheint gro\ss e M\"oglichkeiten f\"ur ein pr\"aziseres und flexibleres Weidesystem zu bieten. Das Z\"aunen k\"onnte sich dadurch wieder mehr in Richtung eines ganzheitlichen H\"utens entwickeln.  Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es in diesem Kontext einen Erkenntnisgewinn im bestehenden System, sowie eine Testung und Evaluierung von M\"oglichkeiten f\"ur ein innovatives H\"uteweidezaunsystem durch Nutzung von virtuellen Z\"aunen zu generieren. Eine Art Hirte 4.0, ein System, welches in der Lage sein sollte, die Bed\"urfnisse der Tiere und der Grasnarbe zu ber\"ucksichtigen, sowie ein r\"aumlich und zeitlich kontinuierliches Monitoring der Tiere zu erm\"oglichen.  Um m\"ogliche Zusammenh\"ange zwischen Futterverf\"ugbarkeit und Bewegungsverhalten und damit der Weidenutzung analysieren zu k\"onnen, wird in Kapitel eins dieser Arbeit der Langzeitweideversuch `FORBIOBEN' mit seinen drei unterschiedlichen Beweidungsintensit\"aten genutzt um st\"undliche und t\"agliche Laufdistanzen sowie die r\"aumliche Verteilung von Fleckvieh K\"uhen mit herk\"ommlichen GPS Halsb\"andern zum Tiermonitoring zu untersuchen. Die Aktivit\"at der K\"uhe nahm mit geringerer Futtermenge zu und die r\"aumliche Verteilung w\"ahrend der, \"uber Tagesganglinien identifizierten, aktiven Zeit der Tiere ist in der h\"ochsten Weideintensit\"at gleichm\"a\ss iger. Es ist jedoch zu bedenken, dass in dieser Studie die Tiere sowohl in der h\"ochsten als auch in der niedrigsten Weideintensit\"at ihre Aktivit\"at steigerten. Es gibt Indizien daf\"ur, dass die Heterogenit\"at sowie allgemein gesprochen die Verteilung der Futterressourcen auf der Weide mit in Betracht gezogen werden m\"ussen, um belastbare Aussagen zur Tierbewegung als Spiegel der Futterverf\"ugbarkeit auf der Weide treffen zu k\"onnen.     Kapitel zwei besch\"aftigt sich erstmals mit der Nutzung von virtuellen Z\"aunen und untersucht, ob ein negativer Effekt von virtueller Z\"aunungstechnologie auf Verhaltensweisen und Tierwohlparameter von Fleckvieh-F\"arsen nachgewiesen werden kann. Kontinuierliche Tierbeobachtungen, Kotproben, Graslandmessungen und Schrittz\"ahlungen lieferten keine Anhaltspunkte f\"ur eine Verschlechterung gegen\"uber der Kontrollgruppe. Ferner konnte gezeigt werden, dass trotz tierindividueller Unterschiede alle Tiere in der Lage waren, das virtuelle Z\"aunungssystem zu erlernen. Die Exklusion der virtuell gez\"aunten Tiere war erfolgreich. Kein Tier hat w\"ahrend des Versuchs die virtuelle Grenze \"uberschritten.    Tiermonitoring auf der Weide kann ein m\"oglicher Zusatznutzen der f\"ur das virtuelle Z\"aunen verwendeten GPS-Halsb\"ander sein. Kapitel drei untersucht im Rahmen eines Rotationsweideversuchs modellhaft Zusammenh\"ange zwischen raumzeitlich explizitem Tierverhalten und Daten aus der drohnenbasierten Fernerkundung der Weidefl\"ache. Diese Informationen, die im Rahmen der Studie validiert werden, k\"onnen in Kombination Aufschluss \"uber Aufenthaltsschwerpunkte, Ver\"anderungen der Biomasse und Tierwohlkriterien geben. Der Abgleich der durch die Halsb\"ander identifizierten Liegezeiten mit Tierbeobachtungsdaten lieferte pr\"azise Ergebnisse. Der Zusammenhang zwischen RGBVI aus UAV und Biomasse war signifikant mit einem moderaten Anteil erkl\"arter Variabilit\"at. Es zeigt sich, dass Tier\"uberwachung auf der Weide durch virtuelle Z\"aunungshalsb\"ander m\"oglich ist und durch die genaue GPS-Verortung der Ereignisse h\"ochst wertvolle Daten liefern kann. Die gelaufenen Distanzen der Tiere, ihre Verteilung auf der Fl\"ache und die Liegezeiten je Tag zeigen einen Effekt der abnehmenden Futterverf\"ugbarkeit. In diesem Zusammenhang verringerten sich Liegezeiten, verl\"angerten sich Laufdistanzen und die Verteilung der Tiere auf der Fl\"ache wurde gleichm\"a\ss iger. Die Drohnendaten der Weidefl\"achen vor und nach der Beweidung zeigten einen deutlichen Zusammenhang zu den mit dem Grasen assoziierten lokalen Aufenthalten der Tiere auf dem untersuchten, vordefinierten 2.5 \texttimes{} 2.5 m Polygon Grid. Weitere Forschung ist erforderlich, um die gesamte Beziehung zwischen dem Verhalten der Tiere auf der Weide und den Drohnendaten zur Definition von u.a. Schwellenwerten f\"ur Futterknappheit nutzen zu k\"onnen.    Insgesamt bauen die Ergebnisse der einzelnen Kapitel aufeinander auf und k\"onnten die ersten Grundvoraussetzungen zur Entwicklung eines innovativen H\"uteweidezaunsystems liefern. Ein Effekt der Futterverf\"ugbarkeit auf das Bewegungsverhalten der Tiere konnte nachgewiesen werden. Das Wohlbefinden der virtuell gez\"aunten Tiere, verglichen mit den konventionell gez\"aunten Tieren, ist in unserem Versuch nicht beeintr\"achtigt, auch wenn weitere Forschung \"uber l\"angere Perioden notwendig ist, um die Ergebnisse weiter zu validieren. Dronenbasierte Fernerkundung zur Aufnahme eines Ist-Zustandes der Fl\"achen kann eine Ausgangsbasis schaffen, die durch die kontinuierliche \"Uberwachung der Tieraufenthalte zu einem besseren Erkennen der verf\"ugbaren Biomasse f\"uhren k\"onnte. Ein entsprechend angepasstes H\"uteweidezaunsystem (Hirte 4.0) k\"onnte helfen die vielf\"altigen Herausforderungen der Weidewirtschaft nachhaltig zu vereinfachen und zu verbessern. Mit Hilfe der Tieraufenthalte aus den Halsbanddaten, die verifiziert mit den UAV Bildern einen Anhaltspunkt zur Ver\"anderung der Grasnarbe liefern, gibt es die M\"oglichkeit mit virtueller Ausz\"aunung der stark genutzten Bereiche schnell zu reagieren und so beispielsweise Bodendegradation zu verhindern. Diese hohe Flexibilit\"at erlaubt es, die bisherigen Graslandsysteme, die stark an den M\"oglichkeiten des Zaunbaus orientiert sind, neu zu denken. Die Technologie des virtuellen Z\"aunens in Kombination mit Remote Sensing k\"onnte ein feinskaliertes Grid Grazing erm\"oglichen, welches effektiv und nachhaltig, sowohl das grasende Tier als auch die Grasnarbe ber\"ucksichtigt.},

Average tree height after 10 years was 187 cm and average root collar diameter was 5.2 cm. Survival was 77\%. More complete burning led to taller shrub and herb vegetation 1 year after burning. This was attributed, in part, to the enhanced invasion of fireweed into burned microsites. Taller vegetation resulted in increased shading of conifer seedlings and increased vegetation press, which reduced tree seedling growth.}

  abstract = {Reasons for performing study: The distance travelled by Australian feral horses in an unrestricted environment has not previously been determined. It is important to investigate horse movement in wilderness environments to establish baseline data against which the movement of domestically managed horses and wild equids can be compared. Objectives: To determine the travel dynamics of 2 groups of feral horses in unrestricted but different wilderness environments. Methods: Twelve feral horses living in 2 wilderness environments (2000 vs. 20,000 km2) in outback Australia were tracked for 6.5 consecutive days using custom designed, collar mounted global positioning systems (GPS). Collars were attached after darting and immobilising the horses. The collars were recovered after a minimum of 6.5 days by re-darting the horses. Average daily distance travelled was calculated. Range use and watering patterns of horses were analysed by viewing GPS tracks overlaid on satellite photographs of the study area. Results: Average distance travelled was 15.9 {$\pm$} 1.9 km/day (range 8.1\textendash 28.3 km/day). Horses were recorded up to 55 km from their watering points and some horses walked for 12 h to water from feeding grounds. Mean watering frequency was 2.67 days (range 1\textendash 4 days). Central Australian horses watered less frequently and showed a different range use compared to horses from central Queensland. Central Australian horses walked for long distances in direct lines to patchy food sources whereas central Queensland horses were able to graze close to water sources and moved in a more or less circular pattern around the central water source. Conclusions: The distances travelled by feral horses were far greater than those previously observed for managed domestic horses and other species of equid. Feral horses are able to travel long distances and withstand long periods without water, allowing them to survive in semi-arid conditions.},

``Data is the central currency of science, but the nature of scientific data has changed dramati- cally with the rapid pace of technology.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 1)
\par
``As a conse- quence,``data'' can now mean anything from petabytes of information stored in professionally maintained databases, to spreadsheets on a single computer, to handwritten tables in lab note- books on shelves.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 1)
\par
``Proper storage is a prerequisite to sharing, and indeed inadequate storage contributes to the phenomenon of data decay or to ``data entropy,'' in which data, whether publicly shared or not, becomesless accessi- ble through time [11\textendash 14].'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 1)
\par
``Best practices for data storage often begin and end with this state- ment: ``Deposit your data in a community standard repository.'''' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 1)
\par
``A data management plan utilizing best practices across all stages of the data life cycle will facili- tate transition from local storage to repository [16].'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 1)
\par
``Good storage practices are important even (or especially)in cases when data may not fit with an existing repository, when only derived data products (versus raw data) are suitable for archiv- ing, or when an existing repository may have lax standards.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``Software and Data Carpentry instructors are scientists from diverse backgrounds who have encountered a variety of data storage challenges and are active in teaching other scientists best practices for scientific computing and data management.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``Rule 1: Anticipate How Your Data Will Be Used'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``Knowing the state in which the data needs to be at each step of the analysis can help to (i) iden- tify software tools to use in converting between data formats, (ii) orient technological choices about how and where the data should be stored, and (iii) rationalize the analysis pipeline, mak- ing it more amenable to re-use [19].'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``Rule 2: Know Your Use Case'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``\textbullet{} Should the raw data be archived (Rule 3)?'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``\textbullet{} Should the data used for analysis be prepared once or re-generated from the raw data each time (and what difference would this choice make for storage, computing requirements, and reproducibility)? \textbullet{} Can manual corrections be avoided in favor of programmatic or self-documenting approaches (e.g., Jupyter notebook or R markdown)? \textbullet{} How will changes to the data be tracked, and where will these tracked changes be logged? \textbullet{} Will the final data be released, and if so, in what format? \textbullet{} Are there restrictions or privacy concerns associated with the data (e.g.,survey results with personally identifiable information [PII], threatened species, or confidential business information)? \textbullet{} Will institutional validation be required prior to releasing the data? \textbullet{} Does the funding agency mandate data deposition in a publicly available archive, and if so, when, where, and under what license? \textbullet{} Does the target journal mandate data deposition?'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 3)
\par
``Rule 3: Keep Raw Data Raw'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 3)
\par
``Since analytical and data processing procedures improve or otherwise change over time, having access to the ``raw'' (unprocessed) data can facilitate future re-analysis and analytical reproduc- ibility. As processing algorithms improve and computational power increases, new analyses will be enabled that were not possible at the time of the original work. If only derived data are stored, it can be difficult for other researchers to confirm analytical results, to assess the validity of statistical models, or to directly compare findings across studies.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 3)
\par
``A cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA or MD5) of the raw data should be generated and distrib- uted with the data. These hashes ensure that the dataset has not suffered any silent corruption and/or manipulation while being stored or transferred (see Internet2 Silent Data Corruption). \\
For large enough datasets, the likelihood of silent data corruption is high. This technique has been widely used by many Linux distributions to distribute images and has been very effective with minimal effort.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 3)
\par
``Rule 4: Store Data in Open Formats'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 3)
\par
``To maximize accessibility and long-term value, it is preferable to store data in formats that have freely available specifications.The appropriate file type will depend on the data being'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 3)
\par
``stored (e.g., numeric measurements, text, images, video), but the key idea is that accessing data should not require proprietary software, hardware, or purchase of a commercial license. Pro- prietary formats change, maintaining organizations go out of business, and changes in license fees make access to data in proprietary formats unaffordable and risky for end-users.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 4)
\par
``Rule 5: Data Should Be Structured for Analysis'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 4)
\par
``One such structure for data stores each variable as a column, each observation as a row, and each type of observational unit as a table (Fig 1). The technical term for this structure is ``Codd's 3rd normal form,'' but it has been made more accessible as the concept of tidy data [24].'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 4)
\par
``One axiom about the structure of data and code holds that one should ``write code for humans, write data for computers'' [25]. When data can be easily imported and manipulated using familiar software (whether via a scripting language, a spreadsheet, or any other computer program that can import these common files), data becomes easier to re-use.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 4)
\par
``Furthermore, having the source code for the software doing the analysis available provides provenance for how the data is processed and analyzed. This makes analysis more transparent, since all assumptions about the structure of the data are implicitly stated in the source code. This also enables extraction of the analyses performed, their reproduction, and their modification.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 4)
\par
``Interoperability is facilitated when variable names are mapped to existing data standards. \\
For instance, for biodiversity data, the DarwinCore Standard provides a set of terms that describe observations,specimens,samples, and related information for a taxa.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 4)
\par
``Rule 6: Data Should Be Uniquely Identifiable'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 5)
\par
``To aid reproducibility, the data used in a scientific publication should be uniquely identifiable. \\
Ideally, datasets should have a unique identifiersuch as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), Archival Resource Key (ARK), or a persistent URL (PURL). An increasing number of online services,such as Figshare, Zenodo, or DataOne, are able to provide these'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 5)
\par
(Hart et al., 2016, p. 5)
\par
``Even as identifierstandards may change over time, datasets can evolve over time as well. In order to distinguish between different versions of the same data, each dataset should have a dis- tinct name, which includes a version identifier. A simple way to do this is to use date stamps as part of the dataset name. Using the ISO 8601 standard avoids regional ambiguities: it mandates the date format YYYY-MM-DD (i.e. from largest time unit to smallest). For example, the date ``February 1, 2015,'' while written as 01-02-2015 in the UK and 02-01-2015 in the US, is unambiguous (2015-02-01) under this standard.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 6)
\par
``Semantic versioning is a richer approach to solving the same problem [27]. The CellPack datasets are an example of this [28]. A semantic version number takes the form: Major. \\
Minor.Patch, e.g., 0.2.7. The major version numbers should be incremented (or bumped) when a dataset scheme has been updated or some other change is made that is not compatible with previous versions of the data with the same major version number. This means that an experiment using version 1.0.0 of the dataset may not run on version 2.0.0 without changes to the data analysis. The minor version should be bumped when a change has been made that is compatible with older versions of the data with the same major version. This means that any analysis that can be performed on version 1.0.0 of the data is repeatable with version 1.1.0 of the data. For example, adding a new year in a temporal surveywill result in a bump in the minor version. The patch version number is bumped when typos or bugs have been fixed. For example version 1.0.1 of a dataset may fix a typo in version 1.0.0.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 6)

``Rule 7: Link Relevant Metadata'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 6)

``You should consider the different data stakeholders when developing privacy proto- cols for your data storage. These stakeholders include funding agencies, human subjects or entities, collaborators, and yourself.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 6)
\par
``In small datasets, a lookup table (protecting PII by removing it and replacing it with a unique ID that maps to the sensitive data in an external dataset) is enough to anonymize a minimal amount of personal information'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 7)

``Hashing techniques are susceptible to a number of attacks, and all hashed data can eventually be determined. Famously, New York City officialsshared what they thought was anonymized data on cab drivers and over 173 million cab rides. How- ever, it was quickly recognized that the city anonymized the data with a simple MD5 hashing scheme and all 20 GB of data were de-anonymized in a matter of hours [30].'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 7)

``Rule 9: Have a Systematic Backup Scheme'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 7)
\par
``Data stored on local computers or institutional servers during the collection and analysis phases of a project should be backed up to other locations to protect against data loss'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 7)
\par
``No backup system is failsafe (see the stories of the Dedoose crash and the near deletion of Toy Story 2), so more than one backup system should be used. Ideally you should have two on-site copies (such as on a computer, an external hard drive, or a tape) and one off-site copy (e.g., cloud storage) [35], with care taken to ensure that the off-site copy is as secure as the on-site copies. Keeping backups in multiple locations additionally protects against data loss due to theft or natural disasters.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 7)
\par
``Common reasons for backup failure include: \textbullet{} faulty backup software \textbullet{} incorrect configuration (e.g., not backing up sub-directories) \textbullet{} encryption (e.g.,someone encrypted the backups but later lost the password to decrypt them) \textbullet{} media errors'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 7)
\par
``Rule 10: The Location and Method of Data Storage Depend on How Much Data You Have'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 7)
\par
``The storage method you should choose depends on the size and nature of your data, the cost of storage and access over time, the time it takes to transfer the data, how the data will be used,'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 7)
\par
``and any privacy concerns.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 8)
\par
``While the cost of storage continues to decrease, the volume of data to be stored impacts the choice of storage methods and locations: for large datasets it is necessary to balance the cost of storage with the time of access and costs of re-generating the data. With new commercial cloud offerings(e.g., Amazon S3) the cost of retrieving the data might exceed the cost of analysis or of re-generating the data from scratch.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 8)
\par
``When data takes too long to transfer or is costly to store, it can become more efficient to use a computer system for analysis that can directly access and use the data in place instead of first transferring it to a local machine.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 8)
\par
``Inactive data can be put in longer-term storage; this is less expensive, but can take longer to retrieve. Some storage systems automatically migrate ``stale'' filesto longer-term storage'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 8)
\par
``Alternatively, some computing can be done ``in the database'' or ``on disk'' via database query languages (e.g., SQL, MapReduce) that perform basic arithmetic, or via the use of procedural languages (e.g., R, Python, C) embedded in the database server. \\
Modern database technologiessuch as HDFS and Spark allow these computations to be done on data of almost any size.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 8)
\par
``When data is larger than locally available RAM, it can be handled by conducting analyses on a ``big memory'' node, which most high-performance computing centers have deployed. Relying on tight software/hardware integration, these can allow for the analysis of datasets around 1\textendash 4 TB in size. This allows the userto read in and use a large dataset without special tools.'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 8)
\par
``If you regularly only need access to a small subset of your data or need to share it with many collaborators, a web-basedAPI (Application Programming Interface) might be a good solution. \\
Using this method, many users can send requests to an online service that can subset the data, perform in-database computation, and return smaller volumes of data as specific slices. Tools based on online services make it easier to find and download data, and they facilitate analysis via reproducible scripts'' (Hart et al., 2016, p. 8)},

Our best model explained 54\% of the variability in breeding-site occurrence with the following variables: vegetation density at the site (0.09 ha), proportion of dense vegetation and variability in vegetation density within a 4.5-ha neighborhood, and amount of floodplain or flat terrain within a 41-ha neighborhood. The density of breeding sites was highest in areas that the model predicted to be most suitable within the project area and at an external test site 200 km away. Conservation efforts must focus on protecting not only occupied patches, but also surrounding riparian forests and floodplain to ensure long-term viability of SWFL. We will use the multiscaled model to map SWFL breeding habitat in Arizona, prioritize future survey effort, and examine changes in habitat abundance and quality over time.},

  abstract = {Feral horse (Equus ferus caballus) populations on public rangelands in the western United States threaten forage production for livestock and wildlife habitat. Interference competition between feral horses and heterospecifics at watering sources can have negative effects on livestock and wildlife. Researchers have documented altered timing and behavior of wild ungulates at water sources when horses were present. The few studies examining these interactions have infrequently occurred within areas specifically managed for feral equids and have not occurred in sites with cattle. We used motion-sensitive cameras at 8 watering sources to document watering activity patterns and construct indices of temporal overlap among feral horses, cattle, elk (Cervus canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) within the Adobe Town Herd Management Area in southern Wyoming, USA, between June and September 2018 and 2019. Feral horses, cattle, and pronghorn exhibited a high degree of temporal overlap ({$>$}79\%) in water use, with feral horses and pronghorn exhibiting the highest estimated percent overlap (88.1\%, 95\% CI = 86.5\textendash 89.6\%). Mule deer and elk watering activity also overlapped with horses and cattle but to a lesser degree ({$<$}55\%). Feral horses spent a mean of 16.7 {$\pm$} 30.5 (SD) minutes during a watering event and were present at a given water source on average 4.5 {$\pm$} 6.3\% and up to 34.9\% of the day, which is less than reported in previous studies. Cattle spent on average 23.5 {$\pm$} 44.9 minutes during a watering event, and were present on average 4.2 {$\pm$} 7.7\% and up to 42.4\% of the day at a single water source. Results of generalized linear mixed-effects models indicated that number of conspecifics was the strongest predictor of visit duration for pronghorn and horses; hour of the day and group size of heterospecifics were informative, but less important, variables. There was no difference in peak visitation time for any species between sites of high versus low horse or cattle use. Despite temporal overlap, we did not find evidence of interference competition between feral horses, cattle, and pronghorn. We recommend future examination of interference competition and its biological consequences between introduced and native ungulates at water sources of varying size across sites, equid population levels, and livestock stocking rates. \textcopyright{} 2020 The Wildlife Society.},

The effects of grazing in the most common scenario, where grazing intensity varies from low to high grazing intensity, are less known. The objectives of this paper were to 1) quantify the effect of stocking rates on species richness and diversity of grasslands world-wide, and 2) evaluate the response under different environmental and experimental conditions. We conducted a meta-analysis of experiments with at least two levels of controlled stocking rates and evaluated their effect on species richness and diversity. The results showed that the response of richness and diversity to either reducing or increasing stocking rate from a moderate level mostly fell within the range  25\% or  5 species. Mean response of species richness and diversity to increasing stocking rate from moderate to high levels was negative. Mean response to lowering stocking rate from moderate levels was not different from zero. However, overall, species richness significantly decreased as stocking rate increased. The response of richness and diversity to stocking rate was not related to mean precipitation, productivity or aridity. However, the most negative responses of richness to stocking rate were larger in arid, low productivity systems than in subhumid and humid systems. The effects of grazing on richness and diversity found in this review were smaller than the effects on species composition shown by the literature. Thus, grazing drastically changes species composition, but the net change of species and diversity is much smaller.},

  abstract = {Geomorphic reclamation creates variable topography and surface architecture, including rolling hillslopes and drainages. In contrast, traditional methods of reclamation result in landscapes susceptible to erosion due to steep, linear gradients. Geomorphic approaches to surface mine reclamation are relatively new, and hypotheses suggest the use of geomorphic principles in reclamation will improve vegetation outcomes relative to traditional methods. Topographic variability created by geomorphic reclamation likely results in more environmental heterogeneity, which should correlate with greater plant diversity. We examined revegetation outcomes of traditional and geomorphic reclamation on two reclaimed surface mines in Wyoming using nadir image sampling. Functional group diversity and measures of cover were compared between reclamation methods and undisturbed rangeland. Geomorphic reclamation supported greater total richness and greater native functional group richness relative to traditional reclamation. Native species cover on geomorphic reclamation, particularly for native perennial grasses, was either similar to undisturbed rangeland or greater than undisturbed rangeland and traditional reclamation. Reclamation shrub cover differed significantly from undisturbed sites, but was greater in geomorphic treatments. Results of nadir image analysis are compared to line-point intercept data from the same locations and outcomes are discussed in light of different reclamation techniques and sampling methods. Significant differences in cover categories were observed between nadir image and line-point intercept methods, however both methods revealed similar patterns between study sites.},

We used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate power for detecting trends with two ordinal models, proportional odds logistic regression (POM) and logistic regression with cover classes rebinned into two categories, a model we term an assessment point model (APM). We include a model fit to the logit-transformed percentage cover data for comparison, which is a latent model. Results: The POM had equal or higher power compared to the APM and latent model, but power varied in complex ways as a function of the assumed latent beta distribution. We discovered that if the latent distribution is skewed, a cover class scheme with more categories might yield higher power to detect trend. Conclusions: Our power analysis method maintains the connection between the observed ordinal cover classes and the unmeasured (latent) percentage cover variable, allowing for a biologically meaningful trend to be defined on the percentage cover scale. Both the shape of the latent beta distribution and the alternative hypothesis should be considered carefully when determining sample size requirements for long-term vegetation monitoring using cover class measurements.},

``CPW is a Microsoft Access database that uses extensive Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code to bring the com- plex functionality of the database to the user in the form of an intuitive, easily accessible graphical user interface. The current application operates on any modern Windows operating sys- tem (XP or newer), with Microsoft Access 2007, 2010 or 2013. Windows users who do not own an Access license can use the database after downloading free Access Runtime soft- ware. Mac users have successfully used CPW to manage their photos by installing Windows in a virtual machine environ- ment, and the same solution will work with Linux operating systems. Because the database is distributed as an .accdb file, all of the design elements of the database (including VBA code) can be accessed by closing the startup form. Thus, if necessary, intermediate users can make modifications to suit the needs of a specific project by leveraging the user-friendly interface and built-in functions provided by Access . Advanced users can further modify the software by altering the VBA or SQL code we provide.'' (Ivan and Newkirk, 2016, p. 3)
\par
``Depending on whether the user opts to make use of the double-observer functionality (see below), the database can store data from'' (Ivan and Newkirk, 2016, p. 3)
\par
``c. 800,000 (double observer) to c. 2,000,000 (single obser- ver) photos when operating as a single file on a personal computer. For large, recurring projects CPW can be modi- fied so that it functions as a `front-end' with tables stored in a more robust enterprise-level database such as SQL Ser- ver . In this case, storage of photo data is unlimited.'' (Ivan and Newkirk, 2016, p. 4)
\par
``The structure of CPW follows a logical hierarchy similar to that reported by previous authors (e.g., Krishnappa \& Turner 2014). Cameras are organized first according to study areas, which are groups of cameras that the user may later want to summarize or compare to other groups based on attributes such as geographic areas, treatments and con- trols, or habitat strata. Within study areas, locations are specified for each camera (or set of cameras if they are deployed in pairs, as is often the case with mark-recapture studies); within locations, information is stored from each time a camera was deployed, checked or retrieved. Once design information regarding study area(s), locations and visits has been entered, photos can be added using the Import Photos form. Users specify which visit the photos should be associated with, which folder contains the photos, and whether and how to copy/rename the photos. This automated import process eliminates the need for manually creating a spreadsheet row or database record for each photo, thus minimizing opportunity for mistakes.'' (Ivan and Newkirk, 2016, p. 4)
\par
``Once photos have been imported, the user logs in to the Photo ID form and navigates through the images in sequential order, providing identifications (ID) of the species in each photo. \\
Photos and data fields appear together in the form and the user can type in identifiers, select them from a menu, or use shortcut keys (including one to repeat all information from the previous photo) to quickly populate the fields (Fig. 1). Each user can customize keyboard shortcuts to suit them, and filters can be employed to focus on photos from a specific location and/or season and/or only those photos that yet need identification. \\
Users can quickly highlight images of particular importance so they can be easily retrieved later for use in reports and presen- tations. Double-clicking on an image opens it in an external program so users can edit or zoom as needed to assist in identi- fication. The form can record any number of species and indi- viduals present in a given image. A batch ID mode is also available such that a particular ID can be applied to an unlim- ited series of photos in a single stroke.'' (Ivan and Newkirk, 2016, p. 4)
\par
``The database is designed such that each photo is viewed by two observers, which improves accuracy of the resulting data. \\
Thus, when a user clicks the filter to only view those images that need ID, the program shows those photos that have not yet been identified by that user and that need identification'' (Ivan and Newkirk, 2016, p. 4)
\par
``from at least one more user. Once photos have been subjected to two observers the database manager or a third observer can then log in to the Compare ID form, which displays those pho- tos in which the two observers disagreed. The manager decides which ID was correct and deletes the other. The database tracks each observer's IDs, even those that were deemed incor- rect and deleted, so that a complete history of the observations is maintained. Note that two observers are not strictly required; if the database manager determines that a single observer per photo is sufficient the database will still function properly.'' (Ivan and Newkirk, 2016, p. 5)
\par
``To expedite the photo ID process, the database manager can use the Photo Viewer form (Fig. 2) to quickly filter the data to a manageable subset, which can then be exported to a modular version of the Photo ID form and shipped to observers on or off site. These modules contain the same species list as the mas- ter database, and observers identify photos as described above (including logging in to the form to register who is assigning the IDs), return the module, and the manager then uses the Import Module form to import identification data into the mas- ter database. As before, mismatched IDs will be flagged and can then be reconciled by the database manager.'' (Ivan and Newkirk, 2016, p. 5)
\par
``Note that it is the user's responsibility to independently track how photos have been distributed to observers, which can be easily done with a simple spreadsheet.'' (Ivan and Newkirk, 2016, p. 5)
\par
``For example, the `General Camera Summary' includes total cameras, total photos, average photos/camera, effort summaries (camera days), and number of photos of each spe- cies. Such a report is available at both the project and location level, and by year. Users can also choose to print a summary of detection data for individual animals, a photo ID summary (list of the number of photos by location along with the num- ber identified by one or two observers and their initials), reports comparing performance of each observer who identi- fied photos, or lists of cameras currently in deployment, includ- ing coordinates and access notes for each.'' (Ivan and Newkirk, 2016, p. 5)
\par
``CPW provides forms to easily generate input files for occu- pancy, abundance, density, or activity pattern analyses per- formed in Programs MARK (White \& Burnham 1999), PRESENCE (Hines 2015), DENSITY (Efford, Dawson \& Robbins 2004), and the R (R Development Core Team 2015) packages `secr' (Efford 2015) and `overlap' (Meredith \& Ridout 2015; Fig. 3)'' (Ivan and Newkirk, 2016, p. 6)
\par
``The user can define which species the files should be built for, and has complete control over the number and length of occa- sions generated. Options are available to allow the user to spec- ify an absolute start date for a survey (e.g., June 1), or a start date that is relative to the set date for each camera, and the user can specify a buffer between when each camera was set and when the survey (and input file) actually begins. Finally, filters are available to create input files for a particular study area, year, or spatial extent. The form provides a preview of the input file and when satisfied, the user can export in a format specific to software mentioned above, or as an Excel spread- sheet or Access query for further modification.''

  abstract = {Contemporary methods for sampling wildlife populations include the use of remotely triggered wildlife cameras (i.e., camera traps). Such methods often result in the collection of hundreds of thousands of photos that must be identified, archived, and transformed into data formats required for statistical analyses. Cpw Photo Warehouse is a freely available software based in Microsoft Access\textregistered{} that has been customized for this purpose using Visual Basic\textregistered{} for Applications (VBA) code. Users navigate a series of point-and-click menu items that allow them to input information from camera deployments, automatically import photos (and image data stored within the photos) related to those deployments, and store data within a relational database. Images are seamlessly incorporated into the database windows, but are stored separately from the database. The database includes menu options that (i) facilitate identification of species within the images, (ii) allow users to view and filter any subset of the databased on study area, species, season, etc., and (iii) produce input files for common analyses such as occupancy, abundance, density and activity patterns using Programs mark, presence, density and the r packages `secr' and `overlap'. Our database makes explicit use of multiple observers, which greatly enhances the efficiency and accuracy with which a large number of photos can be identified. Modular subsets of the data can be distributed to an unlimited number of observers on or off site for identification. Modules are then re-incorporated into the database using a custom import function.},

``A measure is typically selected because: (1) the measure is linked to or directly quantifies a plant parameter of interest; (2) the measure gives some synthetic information about environmental conditions, experimental treatments, or other management information; (3) the measure is repeatable without bias or with known bias; and (4) the data are suitable for comparison or reinterpretation with other studies, available information, or information that will be available in the future.'' (Jeffery Fehmi, 2010, p. 273)

``Aerial cover is the uppermost surface of the vegetation and expressed as a percentage area occupied by each species. The sum of the aerial cover of all species plus the unoccupied area (exposed bare ground) equals 100\%.'' (Jeffery Fehmi, 2010, p. 274)
\par
``Species cover is the cover for each plant species evaluated independently from the cover of other species. It is the independent aerial cover of each species, as if no others occurred in the sample area, expressed as a percentage of the area occupied by each species. The sum of the combined species covers can exceed 100\%, but each individual species cannot have a cover that exceeds 100\%.'' (Jeffery Fehmi, 2010, p. 274)

``Leaf cover is all the layers of vegetation from the uppermost surface to the surface of the soil and is expressed as the sum of the layers (intervening plant parts between the surface and the ground) as a percentage of the area occupied by each species. The sum of the combined species can exceed 100\% and each individual species can exceed 100\%.'' (Jeffery Fehmi, 2010, p. 275)
\par
``Basal cover, defined as the cover where the stem meets the surface of the ground (e.g., Elzinga et al. 1998), appears to be consistently defined but is only in common use in areas dominated by perennial bunch grasses (e.g., Khumalo et al. 2007) and in forestry (but with the stem area being measured at about 1.3 m above the ground; e.g., van Laar \& Akca 2007).''

``For example, when using the point intercept method (sensu Elzinga et al. 1998), if one wanted aerial cover, one would only record the uppermost plant contact (first hit) as the point is lowered. If one wanted species cover, one would record a contact for each species encountered as the point is lowered through the vegetation to the ground. If one wanted leaf cover, one would record all contacts for each'' (Jeffery Fehmi, 2010, p. 276)

\par
``An additional consideration when choosing between species and aerial cover is the variability between years, combined with the within-season changes in plant vigor and growth.

  abstract = {This thesis reports the results of two projects related to the effective management of rangelands. Feeding seeds to cattle to be spread in feces has long been suggested, but the survival of seeds through the digestive tract varies widely and is species-dependent. I studied germination of seven species commonly used for restoration in the Great Basin, and cheatgrass, an invasive annual grass, after exposure to simulated ruminant digestion. Increasing rumen residence time decreased germination rates of all species tested. Previous research indicates that most seeds recovered in the feces of cattle are recovered 24-48 hours after ingestion. Of the species tested, only crested wheatgrass and squirreltail maintained appreciable levels of germination after 48 hours of digestion. These species may be suitable for spread by cattle. The viability of cheatgrass seed declined precipitously after 24 hours of digestion, indicating that cattle likely do not substantially contribute to the spread of cheatgrass through seed consumption. Virtual fences are an emerging animal management technology that use audio cues followed by a mild electrical pulse instead of physical barriers to contain animals. Virtual fences have long been conceptualized as a tool to help land managers achieve livestock production or land management goals, yet little research has focused on figuring out what factors influence virtual fence performance. We evaluated the effect of stocking density, the quantity of forage inside the paddock and the difference between the quantities of forage inside and outside the paddock on the effectiveness of a commercially available virtual fencing system. We tested the virtual fencing system at stocking densities from 5-20 animals/acre and measured stubble height as a proxy for the ii quantity of forage inside the paddock and the difference between the quantities of forage inside and outside the paddock. The predictability and controllability of the electrical pulse have been identified as key components of animal welfare associated with virtual fences, so we also evaluated the effect of stocking density, forage quantity, and the difference in forage quantities inside and outside the paddock on predictability and controllability. We found that neither stocking density, forage quantity, nor the difference in forage quantity inside and outside the paddock influenced the effectiveness of virtual fences or the predictability and controllability of the electrical pulse. This implies that virtual fences are likely to be reliable tools for livestock management in productive settings and for stocking densities up to 20 animals/acre and when stubble heights are at or below common management targets.},

``We tested the virtual fencing system at stocking densities from 5-20 animals/acre and measured stubble height as a proxy for the quantity of forage inside the paddock and the difference between the quantities of forage inside and outside the paddock.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 41)
\par
``We found that neither stocking density, forage quantity, nor the difference in forage quantity inside and outside the paddock influenced the effectiveness of virtual fences or the predictability and controllability of the electrical pulse.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 41) How is effectiveness defined?
\par
``Jakes et al. 2018'' (Jero, 2022, p. 42)
\par
``Whereas conventional fences employ a physical barrier to restrict animal movement, virtual fences rely on associative learning between an audio cue and an aversive, but not harmful, electrical pulse to deter animals from crossing boundaries created by the user through an online user interface (Umstatter 2011).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 42) I really like how this was worded.
\par
``Fay et al. 1989'' (Jero, 2022, p. 43)
\par
``targeted or management-intensive grazing, where animals are often held at high stocking densities for short periods of time in frequently moved paddocks (Bailey et al. 2019; Shawver et al. 2020)'' (Jero, 2022, p. 43)
\par
``Previous studies have assessed the effectiveness of virtual fencing systems using the percentage of reported GPS locations that are inside the paddock (Boyd et al. 2022; Campbell et al. 2020),'' (Jero, 2022, p. 43) Definition of "effectiveness"
\par
``it has several disadvantages for broad applicability, particularly as virtual fencing studies are implemented at ranch scales and over longer periods of time, where routine management activities or seasonal resource changes (e.g. drying of spring water sources fed by snowmelt) may alter livestock habitat use.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 43)
\par
``There are also many non-fence methods used to alter livestock distribution and habitat use (e.g. strategic placement of supplement and/or water) (Creamer et al. 2020'' (Jero, 2022, p. 44)
\par
``The likelihood that differences in livestock management practices or resource availability have the potential to influence location-based estimates of virtual fence effectiveness indicate that other measures of effectiveness should be considered and investigated.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 44)
\par
``A metric that is less sensitive to management actions, the spatial pattern of habitat use, or the location of available resources would have broader applicability than simply reporting the percentage of the time livestock were inside the designated paddock.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 44)
\par
``When virtual fences are consistently successful at turning animals around and keeping them from escaping through the boundary, interaction-based and GPS-based effectiveness measures will be highly correlated because there will be few, if any animals escaping and spending time outside the paddock.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 45)
\par
(Jero, 2022, p. 46)
\par
``The electrical pulse has been demonstrated to be no more stressful than standard animal restraint and management procedures (Kearton et al. 2019), but a recent framework for evaluating the welfare outcomes associated with virtual fences proposed that it was the ability of animals to predict and control the receipt of the electrical pulse that determined stress and welfare outcomes, not the electrical pulse itself (Lee et al. 2018).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 46)
\par
``The purpose of the audio cue is to provide this predictability by allowing animals to stop or turn and retreat from the boundary in order to avoid the electrical pulse (Lee et al. 2009).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 46)
\par
``Cues may signal the imminent occurrence of one or several possible outcomes and change in salience and relevance for behavior according to how reliably they predict future events (Esber and Haselgrove 2011).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 47)
\par
``Therefore, the key to predictability is not simply that the cue chronologically precedes the pulse, per se, but that the association formed between the cue and the pulse is such that the cue tells the animal something about the near future.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 47)
\par
``stating that the cue always precedes the pulse may be equivalent to animals accurately predicting the near future, and some researchers have chosen to define predictability in this way (Lee and Campbell 2021).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 47)
\par
``An alternative definition of predictability in a virtual fence context would be that the animal knows that the audio cue means that it has reached a boundary and will receive the electrical pulse if it keeps moving forward.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 47)
\par
``The animal must alter its behavior (i.e. stop forward motion and/or turn and retreat from the boundary) if it is to avoid the electrical pulse (or terminate its continued delivery).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 47)
\par
``The ability of an animal to do so has been defined as controllability (Lee and Campbell 2021).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 47)
\par
``While it may be difficult to separate learning and motivation in some circumstances (e.g., did the animal receive electrical pulses because it was unable to avoid them, or because it judged resources outside the paddock as worth the risk?), much of behavior stems from learning (Launchbaugh and Howery 2005)'' (Jero, 2022, p. 48)
\par
``During an interaction that is both predictable and controllable, it is reasonable to expect that an animal would approach the boundary, receive the audio cue and then stop or turn and retreat from the boundary, avoiding the electrical pulse entirely. However, during an interaction that is controllable but not predictable, the animal would receive the audio cue but not know what it meant, and would continue forward until it received the electrical pulse, at which time it would stop and/or turn and retreat from the boundary in order to stop delivery of the electrical pulse after receiving a single, or perhaps very few, electrical pulses.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 48) Predictable and Controllable vs. Controllable but Not Predictable
\par
(Jero, 2022, p. 49)
\par
``virtual fences have proven effective at keeping animals from approaching a food reward in experimental settings with trial periods lasting several minutes (Ranches et al. 2021),'' (Jero, 2022, p. 50)
\par
``Stocking density is known to influence diet selection (Brunsvig et al. 2017), so as stocking density changes, an animal's perception of resource availability and its corresponding motivation to seek resources outside the boundary may also change.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 50)
\par
``This study was conducted using a herd of 162 yearling heifers in an intensive riparian grazing setting.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 51)
\par
``Collars sent a message as soon as an animal started interacting with either the audio or electrical pulse zone and every 70 s thereafter until the animal had left both the audio and electrical pulse zones. Hourly status update messages were also sent by the collars. These messages were proprietary in nature but included a non-spatial indicator of whether the animal was inside or outside of the boundary. GPS location messages were sent every 10 minutes.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 53) GPS location messages can be programmed to send at different intervals (ours is 30 minutes).
\par
``The training protocol was created under advisement of staff at Vence Corp and conducted in the 21 ha pasture. On the first day of training, a 5 m wide electrical pulse zone was created on the inside of the north, east, and west sides of the barbed wire perimeter fence of the pasture. On the second day of training, this electrical pulse zone was expanded to 15 m. A 5 m wide audio zone was added to the 15 m electrical pulse zone on the third training day. On the fourth and final day of training, the audio and electrical pulse zone widths were held constant and the north boundary was moved to exclude access to the northernmost part of the pasture where heifers spend a disproportionate amount of time every year (Travis Whitely, manager, Lamoille Unit, Maggie Creek Ranch, personal communication). The study commenced six days after the completion of training.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 54)
\par
``Virtual paddock size was varied to create 11 different stocking densities ranging from 520 animals per acre. The highest stocking density in each pasture was tested first, followed by the rest of the paddocks in ascending order by stocking density (Fig. 3).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 55) Love the use of the term "virtual paddock"
\par
``Additionally, observations suggest that when paddocks are made larger (i.e. stocking density lowered), grazing activity tends to be concentrated in the part of the paddock most recently added (Todd Parker, Vence Corp., personal communication).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 55) Interesting, I wonder if there is a way to test this empirically. So if you go from larger to smaller paddock sizes, this doesn't happen, but if you go from smaller to larger paddock sizes this may happen.
\par
``Residual stubble height is a commonly used riparian management target (Clary and Leininger 2000), and is highly correlated to forage biomass (Lommasson and Jensen 1943).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 55)
\par
(Jero, 2022, p. 56)
\par
``The stubble height in the 50 m immediately outside the northern edge of the paddock was also measured before each run. The stubble height measurements taken inside the paddock before and after each run were averaged to represent stubble height during the run. This average stubble height was subtracted from the stubble height measured outside the paddock to determine the difference in forage'' (Jero, 2022, p. 56)
\par
``quantity between the inside and outside of the paddock (hereafter the difference in stubble heights).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 57)
\par
``For data collection purposes, each run started at 7:00 AM and continued until 6:00 PM the following day, resulting in a 35-hour run at each stocking density. Paddock boundaries activated at 8:30 PM on the day prior to the beginning of the run. To transition from one paddock to the next, boundaries were programmed to move 9 m every 3 min. by expanding the electrical pulse zone. The width of the audio zone did not change. Boundary movement was timed to finish at 6:45 AM, 15 min. prior to the start of the run. Except when boundaries were actively moving, all boundaries consisted of a 30 m wide electrical pulse zone and a 10 m wide audio zone. Any collars that had automatically disabled were re-enabled through HerdManager prior to the start of each run.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 57) Is it possible the 35-hour run was not enough time for the animals to change their distribution in response to the change in virtual fence?
\par
``Individual boundary interaction messages were grouped into interactions if they were sent less than four min. apart, as indicated by non-experimental preliminary data and preliminary analysis on study data (Appendix). Individual interaction messages were used to calculate the number of electrical pulses delivered during the course of an interaction. There was no reliable counter of the number of audio cues delivered during an interaction (Todd Parker, Vence Corp., personal communication), but we assumed that animals received only audio cues during interactions where zero electrical pulses were delivered.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 57)
\par
``Proprietary details of collar function would occasionally block delivery of the electrical pulse at times it would normally have been delivered (Todd Parker, Vence Corp. personal communication). Interactions where this happened were considered malfunctions and excluded from the analysis.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 58)
\par
``Additionally, some animals would occasionally stay in the electrical pulse zone long enough trigger the automatic-disable safety mechanism in the collars. Interactions from these animals were included in the analysis up to and including the interaction when the collar disabled, but excluded thereafter.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 58)
\par
``An interaction was deemed to be successful if the animal remained inside the boundary after an interaction had finished. Whether an animal was inside or outside of the boundary following an interaction was determined one of three ways. First, an interaction was counted as successful if the first GPS location reported after the conclusion of the interaction showed the animal as inside the boundary. Second, the interaction was counted as successful if a collar status message showed the animal to be inside the boundary. Finally, if a new interaction began before either a GPS location message or a collar status message, this was also interpreted as a successful interaction because new interactions must begin from inside the boundary.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 58)
\par
``The first of these indicators to happen following the conclusion of an interaction was used to define success for that interaction.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 58) First in the sense of a timestamp? i.e. which event triggered first?
\par
``Preliminary analysis revealed that only about 5\% of interactions resulted in animals receiving five or more electrical pulses (Appendix).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 58)
\par
``Four electrical pulses would be delivered over a 20 s'' (Jero, 2022, p. 58)
\par
``timeframe (see Methods: Virtual Fencing System). This should give an animal adequate time to respond appropriately and exit the electrical pulse zone if it has learned to do so. We therefore classified interactions where animals received four or fewer electrical pulses as controllable and interactions where animals received five or more electrical pulses as uncontrollable. Interactions where no electrical pulses were delivered were classified as both predictable and controllable (Lee et al. 2018).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 59)
\par
``Interactions with four or fewer electrical pulses were classified as unpredictable and controllable.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 59) Drawing the line at 4 shocks per interaction, while not arbitrary as it was based on preliminary data analysis, might not carry over to another herd of animals due to a variety of circumstances (e.g. temperament). It might be more useful to look at the average or median shocks per interaction.
\par
``Interactions with five or more electrical pulses were classified as uncontrollable.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 59)
\par
``We did not classify uncontrollable interactions (Fig. 2 C) as either predictable or unpredictable because we did not believe it was possible to separate predictable-uncontrollable and unpredictableuncontrollable interactions using the number of electrical pulses.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 59)
\par
(Jero, 2022, p. 60)
\par
``We recognized the small size of the dataset and the corresponding limited ability to fit large numbers of terms. We therefore selected potential interactions in an Akaike's Information Criterion framework while keeping all main effects (pasture, stocking density, and stubble height or the difference in stubble heights) in each model. Models containing all combinations of potential interactions were ranked using Quasi-AIC adjusted for small samples sizes (QAICc) due to overdispersion (Burnham and Anderson 2002; Lebreton et al. 1992). The model with the lowest QAICc was used for inference. All models were fit using the function `glm' with the logit link and the quasibinomial family to account for overdispersion in R version 4.2.1 (R Core Team 2022).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 60)
\par
``Because virtual fences must work if they are to be a useful management tool, it is critical to understand what factors influence their performance in conditions likely to be encountered as commercial adoption of this technology proceeds'' (Jero, 2022, p. 63)
\par
``Ultimately, between the direction and small size of the estimated effect, it is likely safe for producers to assume that virtual fence effectiveness will remain consistently high or improve slightly as stock densities increase from 5 to 20 animals/acre under conditions similar to those used in this study.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 65)
\par
``Additionally, virtual fences remained effective even when stubble height was nearly 10 cm higher outside the paddock. This means that virtual fences will likely be good tools to manage riparian strip grazing or fuel break creation, where there may be an obvious difference in the amount of forage inside and outside the boundary.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 66)
\par
``That being said, it is important to note that our results are consistent with other studies which have shown that virtual fences are highly, but not entirely, effective at keeping animals inside the boundary (Boyd et al. 2022; Campbell et al. 2017).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 66)
\par
``While previous studies that have examined predictability and controllability have used direct measures of stress responses (e.g., cortisol and body temperature) (Kearton et al. 2020; Kearton et al. 2019), Lee and Campbell (2021) suggested that the numbers of audio cues and electrical pulses delivered during an interaction could be used to evaluate predictability and controllability.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 67)
\par
``We found this unsurprising because predictability and controllability are established during learning (Lee et al. 2018; Ursin and Eriksen 2004), and cattle used in this study underwent a multi-day learning protocol prior to the beginning of the study.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 67)
\par
``During this study predictability ranged from 59-80\% and controllability ranged from 9298\%. Controllability was consistently high, but predictability could potentially be increased by refinement in implementation or adjustment of the audio or electrical pulse zone widths'' (Jero, 2022, p. 67) Like what Brandon is testing with the training study.
\par
``When possible, the placement of boundaries along visually prominent landscape features such as roads may increase predictability by more clearly communicating boundary location, but may result in animals associating the boundary location and electrical pulse with the visual marker rather than the audio cue (Umstatter et al. 2015'' (Jero, 2022, p. 67) Need to test this empirically.
\par
``Reducing the width of the audio cue zone may increase predictability by strengthening the relationship between the audio cue and the electrical pulse. On the other hand, widening the audio cue zone may increase controllability by allowing animals'' (Jero, 2022, p. 67)
\par
``a larger area in which to appropriately respond to the audio cue and avoid the electrical pulse entirely.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 68)
\par
``Foraging theory provides evidence that animals avoid novel foods or environments when resources are adequate, but will more readily try new strategies to meet physiological requirements when conditions are limiting (Provenza et al. 1998).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 68)
\par
``Social interaction of study and non-study animals across barbed wire fences may also have contributed to the high overdispersion observed. Inverted collars may also have contributed to overdispersion.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 69)
\par
``Virtual fence studies with different boundary locations have'' (Jero, 2022, p. 69)
\par
``primarily expanded the area to which animals have access (Campbell et al. 2017; Campbell et al. 2020). During this study, most boundary location changes reduced the area to which animals had access, and animals appeared to recognize and respect the new boundary location, which is consistent with the behavior observed in another study (Campbell et al. 2019a).'' (Jero, 2022, p. 70)
\par
``Stocking density did not affect or slightly enhanced virtual fence effectiveness as stocking densities increased up to 20 animals/acre. Likewise, virtual fences were effective even when stubble heights were well below common management targets or were taller outside the paddock.'' (Jero, 2022, p. 71)
\par
``Predictability and controllability were not affected by stocking density or the quantity of forage inside or outside of the paddock'' (Jero, 2022, p. 71)},

  abstract = {Fitness of female ungulates is determined by neonate survival and lifetime reproductive success. Therefore, adult female ungulates should adopt behaviors and habitat selection patterns that enhance survival of neonates during parturition and lactation. Parturition site location may play an important role in neonatal mortality of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) when lambs are especially vulnerable to predation, but parturition sites are rarely documented for this species. Our objectives were to assess environmental characteristics at desert bighorn parturition, lamb nursery, and predation sites and to assess differences in habitat characteristics between parturition sites and nursery group sites, and predation sites and nursery group sites. We used vaginal implant transmitters (VITs) to identify parturition sites and capture neonates. We then compared elevation, slope, terrain ruggedness, and visibility at parturition, nursery, and lamb predation sites with paired random sites and compared characteristics of parturition sites and lamb predation sites to those of nursery sites. When compared to random sites, odds of a site being a parturition site were highest at intermediate slopes and decreased with increasing female visibility. Odds of a site being a predation site increased with decreasing visibility. When compared to nursery group sites, odds of a site being a parturition site had a quadratic relationship with elevation and slope, with odds being highest at intermediate elevations and intermediate slopes. When we compared predation sites to nursery sites, odds of a site being a predation were highest at low elevation areas with high visibility and high elevation areas with low visibility likely because of differences in hunting strategies of coyote (Canis latrans) and puma (Puma concolor). Parturition sites were lower in elevation and slope than nursery sites. Understanding selection of parturition sites by adult females and how habitat characteristics at these sites differ from those at predation and nursery sites can provide insight into strategies employed by female desert bighorn sheep and other species during and after parturition to promote neonate survival. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

We used GPS data and field plot utilization indices to examine cattle selection at the landscape and patch levels, respectively, within a heterogeneous Montane environment of SW Alberta, Canada. We also evaluated factors associated with patterns of summer cattle use, including topographic features, distance to water and roads, as well as forage quantity and quality. Cattle preferred lowland and upland grasslands, while avoiding conifer forests and clear cuts. Selection patterns differed markedly between the landscape and plot scales. At the landscape scale, forage use was related to abiotic factors, primarily slope ({$\beta$}=-0.70) but also distance to water (-0.34) and distance from roads (+0.21). The negative impact of slope was greater than that observed in previous studies, and has implications for identifying primary ranges and deriving sustainable carrying capacities in Montane landscapes. At the plot (feeding patch) scale, forage use was additionally related to biomass availability ({$\beta$}=+0.58), and to a lesser extent crude protein concentration (+0.16), highlighting the importance of forage characteristics in regulating cattle use. Lowland grasslands had the highest biomass and received the greatest forage use (43\% utilization). Low visitation (44\% of plots) and associated forage use (3\% herbage utilization) by cattle within cut blocks, combined with conservative forage use across all habitats (3\textendash 43\%), indicate grazing by cattle is consistent with maintaining other uses within this area, including riparian function, native grassland conservation and forest management.},

  abstract = {Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) use of Sheep Lakes mineral site, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA, has decreased since 1996. Officials were concerned that human disturbance may have been contributing to this decline in use. We evaluated effects of vehicular traffic and other road-related disturbance on bighorn use of Sheep Lakes in the summers of 2002 and 2003. We found that the time and number of attempts required by bighorn to reach Sheep Lakes was positively related to the number of vehicles and people present at Sheep Lakes. Further, the number of bighorn individuals and groups attempting to visit Sheep Lakes were negatively affected by disturbance associated with the site. The number of vehicles recorded the hour before bighorn tried to access Sheep Lakes best predicted an animal's failure to cross Fall River Road and reach Sheep Lakes. We conclude that human and road-related disturbance at Sheep Lakes negatively affected bighorn use of the mineral site. Because Sheep Lakes may be important for bighorn sheep, especially for lamb production and survival, the negative influence of disturbance may compromise health and productivity of the Mummy Range bighorn sheep.},
  note = {Annotated Bibliography
\par
Anthropogenic disturbances can alter ungulate behavior and limit use of areas adjacent to the disturbance, and may expend energy to avoid the disturbance.
\par
Bighorn sheep are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances, and often will avoid areas with high levels of anthropogenic disturbance, such as roads, water sources, and mineral licks.
\par
Amount of traffic and proximity to roads increases avoidance by bighorn sheep.
\par
Response to anthropogenic disturbance can manifest as physiological responses such as increased heart rate, increased energy expenditure, increased susceptibility to disease, and adrenal gland enlargement (stress), however these negative effects are potentially mitigated by habituation.
\par
Presence of bighorn sheep was negatively influenced by the amount of traffic and number of visitors present at the viewing site.
\par
Road in this study averaged 173 vehicles/hour, peaked at 500 vehicles/hour. In other studies MacArthur et al. 1982 reported minimal disturbance to bighorn with peak of 25-30 vehicles/hours.
\par
Use of mineral lick site by bighorn sheep complicated by human use factors, likely as a result of both humans and bighorns are diurnal animals.
\par
Fewer bighorn sheep access mineral lick site with increasing minimum number of people and vehicles present at the viewing area. Maximum number of vehicles and people related to increasing amount of time needed to cross road and number of attempts to cross road.
\par
Bighorn sheep may not outwardly exhibit behavioral responses to anthropogenic disturbances, instead these response may manifest as physiological responses such as~ increased heart rate. These anthropogenic stressors may manifest as physiologic costs which compromise immune system function and predispose a herd of bighorn sheep to diseases such as pneumonic pasteurellosis (See MacArthur et al. 1982)
\par
Bighorn rarely disperse and generally do not explore new terrain.
\par
Areas with high levels of human disturbance may be abandoned by bighorn sheep even without loss of resources (see DeForge 1981, Papouchis et al. 2001)

  abstract = {Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) use of Sheep Lakes mineral site, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA, has decreased since 1996. Officials were concerned that human disturbance may have been contributing to this decline in use. We evaluated effects of vehicular traffic and other road-related disturbance on bighorn use of Sheep Lakes in the summers of 2002 and 2003. We found that the time and number of attempts required by bighorn to reach Sheep Lakes was positively related to the number of vehicles and people present at Sheep Lakes. Further, the number of bighorn individuals and groups attempting to visit Sheep Lakes were negatively affected by disturbance associated with the site. The number of vehicles recorded the hour before bighorn tried to access Sheep Lakes best predicted an animal's failure to cross Fall River Road and reach Sheep Lakes. We conclude that human and road-related disturbance at Sheep Lakes negatively affected bighorn use of the mineral site. Because Sheep Lakes may be important for bighorn sheep, especially for lamb production and survival, the negative influence of disturbance may compromise health and productivity of the Mummy Range bighorn sheep.},

\par
Anthropogenic disturbances can alter ungulate behavior and limit use of areas adjacent to the disturbance, and may expend energy to avoid the disturbance.
\par
Bighorn sheep are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances, and often will avoid areas with high levels of anthropogenic disturbance, such as roads, water sources, and mineral licks.
\par
Amount of traffic and proximity to roads increases avoidance by bighorn sheep.
\par
Response to anthropogenic disturbance can manifest as physiological responses such as increased heart rate, increased energy expenditure, increased susceptibility to disease, and adrenal gland enlargement (stress), however these negative effects are potentially mitigated by habituation.
\par
Presence of bighorn sheep was negatively influenced by the amount of traffic and number of visitors present at the viewing site.
\par
Road in this study averaged 173 vehicles/hour, peaked at 500 vehicles/hour. In other studies MacArthur et al. 1982 reported minimal disturbance to bighorn with peak of 25-30 vehicles/hours.
\par
Use of mineral lick site by bighorn sheep complicated by human use factors, likely as a result of both humans and bighorns are diurnal animals.
\par
Fewer bighorn sheep access mineral lick site with increasing minimum number of people and vehicles present at the viewing area. Maximum number of vehicles and people related to increasing amount of time needed to cross road and number of attempts to cross road.
\par
Bighorn sheep may not outwardly exhibit behavioral responses to anthropogenic disturbances, instead these response may manifest as physiological responses such as~ increased heart rate. These anthropogenic stressors may manifest as physiologic costs which compromise immune system function and predispose a herd of bighorn sheep to diseases such as pneumonic pasteurellosis (See MacArthur et al. 1982)
\par
Bighorn rarely disperse and generally do not explore new terrain.
\par
Areas with high levels of human disturbance may be abandoned by bighorn sheep even without loss of resources (see DeForge 1981, Papouchis et al. 2001)
\par
Anthropogenic disturbances from roads may manifest as behavioral, physiological, or physical effects, and the corresponding stress response from each individual impacts each bighorn's health, which affects each individual's survival and productivity, ultimately altering the population dynamics and potentially leading to population declines.},

Temporary emigration can be viewed more generally as involving transitions to and from an unobservable state, and frequently the state itself is one of biological interest (e.g., ?nonbreeder?). Development of models that permit estimation of relevant parameters in the presence of an unobservable state requires either extra information (e.g., as supplied by Pollock's robust design) or the following classes of model constraints: reducing the order of Markovian transition probabilities, imposing a degree of determinism on transition probabilities, removing state specificity of survival probabilities, and imposing temporal constancy of parameters. The objective of the work described in this paper is to investigate estimability of model parameters under a variety of models that include an unobservable state.

An example analysis of sea turtle capture?recapture data under two different models showed similar point estimates but increased precision for the model that incorporated ancillary data (the robust design) when compared to the model with deterministic transitions only.

  abstract = {In many savanna ecosystems worldwide, livestock share the landscape and its resources with wildlife. The nature of interactions between livestock and wildlife is a subject of considerable interest and speculation, yet little controlled experimental research has been carried out. Since 1995, we have been manipulating the presence and absence of cattle and large mammalian herbivore wildlife in a Kenyan savanna in order to better understand how different herbivore guilds influence habitat use by specific wildlife species. Using dung counts as a relative assay of herbivore use of the different experimental plots, we found that cattle had a range of effects, mostly negative, on common mesoherbivore species, including both grazers and mixed feeders, but did not have significant effects on megaherbivores. The effect of cattle on most of the mesoherbivore species was contingent on both the presence of megaherbivores and rainfall. In the absence of megaherbivores, wild mesoherbivore dung density was 36\% lower in plots that they shared with cattle than in plots they used exclusively, whereas in the presence of megaherbivores, wild mesoherbivore dung density was only 9\% lower in plots shared with cattle than plots used exclusively. Cattle appeared to have a positive effect on habitat use by zebra (a grazer) and steinbuck (a browser) during wetter periods of the year but a negative effect during drier periods. Plots to which cattle had access had lower grass and forb cover than plots from which they were excluded, while plots to which megaherbivores had access had more grass cover but less forb cover. Grass cover was positively correlated with zebra and oryx dung density while forb cover was positively correlated with eland dung density. Overall these results suggest that interactions between livestock and wildlife are contingent on rainfall and herbivore assemblage and represent a more richly nuanced set of interactions than the longstanding assertion that cattle simply compete with (grazing) wildlife. Specifically, rainfall and megaherbivores seemed to moderate the negative effects of cattle on some mesoherbivore species. Even if cattle tend to reduce wildlife use of the landscape, managing simultaneously for livestock production (at moderate levels) and biodiversity conservation is possible.},

  abstract = {The intensity and the magnitude of saliva cortisol responses were investigated during the first 48~h following birth in newborn dairy calves which underwent normal (eutocic, EUT, n\,=\,88) and difficult (dystocic, DYS, n\,=\,70) calvings. The effects of parity and body condition of the dam, the duration of parturition, the time spent licking the calf, the sex and birth weight of the calf were also analyzed. Neonatal salivary cortisol concentrations were influenced neither by factors related to the dam (parity, body condition) nor the calf (sex, birth weight). The duration of parturition and the time spent licking the calf also had no effect on salivary cortisol levels. Salivary cortisol concentrations increased rapidly after delivery in both groups to reach their peak levels at 45 and 60~min after delivery in EUT and DYS calves, respectively supporting that the birth process means considerable stress for calves and the immediate postnatal period also appears to be stressful for newborn calves. DYS calves exhibited higher salivary cortisol concentrations compared to EUT ones for 0 (P\,=\,0.022), 15 (P\,=\,0.016), 30 (P\,=\,0.007), 45 (P\,=\,0.003), 60 (P\,=\,0.001) and 120~min (P\,=\,0.001), and for 24~h (P\,=\,0.040), respectively. Peak levels of salivary cortisol and the cortisol release into saliva calculated as AUC were higher in DYS than in EUT calves for the 48-h of the sampling period (P\,=\,0.009 and P\,=\,0.003, respectively). The greater magnitude of saliva cortisol levels in DYS calves compared to EUT ones suggest that difficult parturition means severe stress for bovine neonates and salivary cortisol could be an opportunity for non-invasive assessment of stress during the early neonatal period in cattle.},

The largest increases occurred in riparian species, open-cup nesters, Neotropical migrants, and insectivores. Species of the Chihuahuan desert-scrub, in which vegetation changed the least, showed the smallest increases. Only a few of the species showed increasing regional trends for the same period, as demonstrated by the North American Breeding Bird Survey; thus, increases on the San Pedro Riparian NCA were likely caused by the change in local conditions, not by regional effects.

  abstract = {Background In many areas, livestock are grazed within wolf (Canis lupus) range. Predation and harassment of livestock by wolves creates conflict and is a significant challenge for wolf conservation. Wild prey, such as elk (Cervus elaphus), perform anti-predator behaviors. Artificial selection of cattle (Bos taurus) might have resulted in attenuation or absence of anti-predator responses, or in erratic and inconsistent responses. Regardless, such responses might have implications on stress and fitness. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared elk and cattle anti-predator responses to wolves in southwest Alberta, Canada within home ranges and livestock pastures, respectively. We deployed satellite- and GPS-telemetry collars on wolves, elk, and cattle (n = 16, 10 and 78, respectively) and measured seven prey response variables during periods of wolf presence and absence (speed, path sinuosity, time spent head-up, distance to neighboring animals, terrain ruggedness, slope and distance to forest). During independent periods of wolf presence (n = 72), individual elk increased path sinuosity (Z = -2.720, P = 0.007) and used more rugged terrain (Z = -2.856, P = 0.004) and steeper slopes (Z = -3.065, P = 0.002). For cattle, individual as well as group behavioral analyses were feasible and these indicated increased path sinuosity (Z = -2.720, P = 0.007) and decreased distance to neighbors (Z = -2.551, P = 0.011). In addition, cattle groups showed a number of behavioral changes concomitant to wolf visits, with variable direction in changes. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest both elk and cattle modify their behavior in relation to wolf presence, with potential energetic costs. Our study does not allow evaluating the efficacy of anti-predator behaviors, but indicates that artificial selection did not result in their absence in cattle. The costs of wolf predation on livestock are often compensated considering just the market value of the animal killed. However, society might consider refunding some additional costs (e.g., weight loss and reduced reproduction) that might be associated with the changes in cattle behaviors that we documented.},

Nine of 17 marked ewes altered their watering patterns in response to construction activities.

  abstract = {Alterations of behavior and movement of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) in the River Mountains, Nevada, were coincident with construction activities near the population's primary watering site. The juxtaposition of construction efforts and summer water dependence of bighorn sheep caused a significant shift in use of artificial water sources. Nine of 17 marked ewes altered their watering patterns in response to construction activities. Productivity during construction did not depart from the long-term population mean; however, lamb survival may have been affected. Responses of the River Mountain herd to construction activities were dampened by a high degree of habituation to man.}

  abstract = {Ecological disturbance is a driving force that structures ecosystems and shapes landscape pattern. Wildfire is a widespread form of ecological disturbance, and in some vegetation communities fires are increasing in extent and severity. Across the gradient of fire severity, fire can have both positive and negative effects on animals, where some species require mature climax vegetation conditions and other species select for early successional stages. However, further work is necessary to understand how large mammalian herbivore and carnivore populations respond to the gradient of fire severity. The overall objective of this research was to understand the relative roles of fire, landscape, and human factors across the gradient of fire severity on occupancy and/or relative habitat use of large herbivores (i.e., elk and mule deer) and carnivores (i.e., black bear, mountain lion, and gray wolf) seven years post fire. We predicted that animals would increase use of areas characterized by higher fire severity (moderate, moderate/high, or high fire severity) and heterogeneity, where food resources were expected to be greatest. In addition, road density could either increase or decrease animal use of areas, where some animals might increase use near roads due to increased forage along roadsides or decrease use due to higher human activity. Remote wildlife (RW) cameras sampled the gradient of fire severity seven years post a large mixed-severity wildfire (Wallow Fire, year 2011, 2,177~km2) in the White Mountains of Arizona, USA. We evaluated RW camera data using single-species occupancy and Royle-Nichols (relative habitat use) models. As predicted, large mammals (black bear, elk, mountain lion, mule deer, and wolves) exhibited high occupancy and/or habitat use in relation to higher levels of fire severity and/or fire heterogeneity, which was likely related to bottom-up factors related to increased food resources. Some species (black bear and elk) also exhibited relatively high use of unburned forest. Elk reduced use of areas with higher road density, likely to avoid human activity, whereas mule deer increased use of areas with high road density. Mixed-severity wildfire may provide important resources, including pulses of food in early successional forests. Thus, allowing fire-adapted forests to experience mixed-severity wildfire is predicted to benefit some large herbivore and carnivore populations. If high occupancy and/or habitat use by wildlife in areas experiencing higher fire severity and heterogeneity translates into increased populations of animals, wildfire might be beneficial to humans, focal wildlife populations, and fire-adapted ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Virtual fencing (VF) has the potential to revolutionise control of livestock movement. Cattle can associate an audio cue with a mild electrical shock. This study investigates individual animal learning with VF collars, and if training time can be reduced using a visual cue (VC). The experiment utilised dog training collars fitted in Moo Monitors. 12 non-lactating dairy cows were subjected to one of 2 treatments: 1) Virtual Fence (VF) only 2) visual cue with VF (VC). Habituation to the laneway, pellets and manual collars occurred 2 x per day for 4 days prior to testing. Testing was performed in a laneway for 4 days. A VF line was set before a feed trough with pellets at the end of the laneway, and moved 10m closer to the holding yard each day for 3 days. Cows received an audio cue for 1 sec at the fence line. If they kept moving forward they received a mildly aversive electric shock. After 3 tests the VC was removed and the test repeated. Animal behaviour, and number of cues received was recorded. The visual cue reduced the number of times cows tested the fence line, with VC cows receiving less cues (mean 2.13) than VF cows (mean 4) overall (P=0.007). The number of cues reduced with each test (P{$<$}0.001), however increased with removal of the VC. The VC group received the most cues when the VC was removed (P{$<$}0.001). There is variation in response and learning of a VF, and results indicate that a visual cue is does not improve learning of associated cues.},

``Virtual fencing and herding technology involves the control of an animal's movement, positioning and groupings without ground-based fencing. This can be achieved by altering the animal's behaviour through sensory cues, electric shock, and the establishment of associative learning administered by radio-controlled collars'' (Lomax et al., 2017, p. 2)
\par
``Cattle have been trained by associative learning to avoid an area, feed attractant, and or group, when paired with an audio cue and electrical stimuli delivered by radio- controlled collars (Lee, Henshall, et al., 2009).'' (Lomax et al., 2017, p. 2)
\par
``multiparous'' (Lomax et al., 2017, p. 3)
\par
``Virtual fence collars The collars were manual versions of the commercial prototype virtual fence devices (Agersens ``eShepherd''). They incorporated a modified electric shock dog training device (ET300 mini Educator, E-Collar Technologies Inc, USA) in a commercial cattle health monitor collar (Moo Monitor, Dairymaster, Ireland).'' (Lomax et al., 2017, p. 3)
\par
``The virtual fence was simulated using manual control of audio cue and electric shock. Administration was via a remote device with separate buttons for audio cue and electric shock. When the animal approached the audio cue line, an audio cue was administered for 1 second. If the animal continued toward the feed trough, a mild electric shock was administered for less than 1 sec. If the animal continued toward the feed trough and reached the feed trough, it was allowed to consume the pellets and the test period concluded. Each test period was videotaped and animal behavioural responses described as per Lee et al (2009).'' (Lomax et al., 2017, p. 4)
\par
``Data was subjected to a restricted maximum likelihood logistic regression (REML, Genstat \\
Version 18, VSNi UK). Number of audio cues, number of shocks and total number of stimuli \\
were assessed against treatment and test number'' (Lomax et al., 2017, p. 4) look up this statistical method
\par
``These cows are accustomed to the electrified tape that was used in \\
the study as a visual cue'' (Lomax et al., 2017, p. 4) We're the cattle reacting to the electrical fence rather than the virtual fence? What the results be different if the visual key was a novel stimulus?
\par
``Between tests 1 and 3, the number of cues reduced with each test, indicated cow learning of the'' (Lomax et al., 2017, p. 4)

``fence and the cues. When the VC was removed, the number of cues received increased significantly, indicating that cows had not learned to associated the visual cue with the virtual fence cues.'' (Lomax et al., 2017, p. 5)
\par
``Cows were allowed to move down the laneway to access the \\
pellets without any stimuli once per day. It was evident that as testing continued cows were less \\
inclined to move down the laneway and required encouragement'' (Lomax et al., 2017, p. 5) This suggests that cows learn to avoid negative associayions, and may avoid virtual fences for some period of time after virtual fences are removed.
\par
``Spatial memory is strong in cows, and there is a need to continue positive reinforcement to break the association of the laneway with negative VF cues.'' (Lomax et al., 2017, p. 5)},

We compared patterns of range use, site fidelity, and timing of migration before, during, and after project construction. Coincidental with the first year of project construction, caribou were less likely to be found within 3 km of the site; this persisted at least 2 years after construction was completed. Relative timing of migration was individual-specific; the rank order of spring arrival on, and autumn departure from, the calving and summer grounds tended to be consistent year-to-year. This is the first report of such individual-specific consistency in migration for a non-avian species. This predictability disappeared during development: the year-to-year consistency of fall and spring migration among individuals was apparent before and after construction, but not during construction. Variation in calving site fidelity was correlated to year-to-year differences in snowfall. We conclude that the development caused a disruption of migrational timing during construction and longer-term diminished use of the range surrounding the project site.

  abstract = {We investigated the effects of hydroelectric development on the movements and space-use of caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in west-central Newfoundland, Canada. We compared patterns of range use, site fidelity, and timing of migration before, during, and after project construction. Coincidental with the first year of project construction, caribou were less likely to be found within 3 km of the site; this persisted at least 2 years after construction was completed. Relative timing of migration was individual-specific; the rank order of spring arrival on, and autumn departure from, the calving and summer grounds tended to be consistent year-to-year. This is the first report of such individual-specific consistency in migration for a non-avian species. This predictability disappeared during development: the year-to-year consistency of fall and spring migration among individuals was apparent before and after construction, but not during construction. Variation in calving site fidelity was correlated to year-to-year differences in snowfall. We conclude that the development caused a disruption of migrational timing during construction and longer-term diminished use of the range surrounding the project site. Long-term studies of individually marked animals can aid in environmental assessments for migratory animals.},

``At 16 Daubenmire quadrats, the mean cover value and difference in cover across iterations for annual grasses, perennial grasses, and forbs were 5 ({$\pm$} 4)\%, 10 ({$\pm$} 3)\%, and 6 ({$\pm$} 3)\%, respectively (see Table 1). These values are similar to the differences Thacker et al.1 found between line-point intercept and Daubenmire quadrats, approximately 3\%, 9\%, and 7\%, for annual grasses, perennial grasses, and forbs, respectively. This suggests that differences in cover values between the two sampling methods could have been a result of random sampling effects.'' (Martyn et al., 2015, p. 4)},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the potential responses of forage plants to grazing by different classes of livestock has application in grassland research and management. Cattle (Bos taurus) are less adapted to graze individual plant parts (leaves vs. stems) selectively than are sheep (Ovis aries), goats (Capra hircus), or horses (Equis caballus). Diet preference differs among animal types and this may influence botanical composition and productivity of the sward. An example reported from grazing white clover (Trifolium repens L.)-ryegrass (Lolium spp.) pastures showed that lambs consumed greater portions of white clover and smaller portions of grass and dead material than calves. The diet selected by goat kids was intermediate between that selected by calves and lambs. Different grazing intensities may change the morphology of plant growth. Animals may affect pasture composition and growth from treading and through their deposits of dung and urine. Generally, legumes are less resistant to treading than grasses. On P-deficient soils, cattle dung tends to promote legume growth and N in the urine promotes grass growth. Thiamine from herbivore saliva deposited during grazing may promote subsequent regrowth of grasses. Incorporation of animal defoliation in the early phases of forage evaluation is recommended for characterizing plant responses to grazing livestock.},

We examined seasonal food habits, dietary overlap, and dietary quality of sympatric feral horses (Equus caballus), cattle (Bos taurus),, and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in south-eastern Oregon from May 1979 through March 1981. Seasonal diets of each ungulate species were determined by microhistological analysis of feces. At least 88\% of the mean annual diets of horses and cattle consisted of grasses. Principal species consumed by these ungulates were bottlebrush squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix (Nutt.) J.G.Smith), bearded bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum (Pursh) Scribn. \& Smith), and Thurber needlegrass (Stipa thurberiana Piper). Because dietary overlap between horses and cattle was high each season (62-78\%), we concluded a strong potential existed for exploitative competition under conditions of limited forage availability. Pronghorn diets consisted largely of woody sagebrush (Artemisia) species in fall and winter, and a mixture of forbs in spring and summer. Dietary overlap between horses and pronghorn varied from 7\% (summer) to 26\% (winter). Overlap between cattle and pronghorn varied from 8\% (winter) to 25\% (spring). These lower levels of overlap indicate a wider buffer between noncompetitive coexistence and exploitative competition. Pronghorn generally selected diets containing higher levels of crude protein (CP) and lower levels of acid-detergent fiber (ADF) than horses or cattle. We observed few differences in seasonal dietary quality between horses and cattle.]},

The second postulates resource partitioning through the use of different plant species. As domestic horses and cattle are used widely in Europe for the management of conservation areas, particularly in wetlands, a good knowledge of their foraging behaviour and comparative nutrition is necessary. 2 In this paper we describe resource-use by horses and cattle in complementary studies in two French wetlands. Horses used marshes intensively during the warmer seasons; both species used grasslands intensively throughout the year; cattle used forbs and shrubs much more than horses. Niche breadth was similar and overlap was high (Kulczinski's index 0{$\cdot$}58\textendash 0{$\cdot$}77). Horses spent much more time feeding on short grass than cattle. These results from the two sites indicate strong potential for competition. 3 Comparative daily food intake, measured in the field during this study for the first time, was 63\% higher in horses (144 gDM kg W-0{$\cdot$}75 day-1) than in cattle (88 gDM kg W-0{$\cdot$}75 day-1).

When food is limiting, horses should outcompete cattle in habitats dominated by grasses because their functional response is steeper; under these circumstances cattle will require an ecological refuge for survival during winter, woodland or shrubland with abundant dicotyledons. 4 Horses are a good tool for plant management because they remove more vegetation per unit body weight than cattle, and use the most productive plant communities and plant species (especially graminoids) to a greater extent. They feed closer to the ground, and maintain a mosaic of patches of short and tall grass that contributes to structural diversity at this scale.

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare foraging behavior of mature Raramuri Criollo (RC, heritage breed) and Angus Hereford crossbred (AH, commercial breed) cows grazing Chihuahuan Desert rangeland during summer and winter in three consecutive years. Movement, activity, and spatial distribution variables were calculated from 10-min interval GPS positions of 5\textendash 11 randomly selected cows of each breed. Thirteen pasture pixel attributes were used to analyze grazing utilization and selection patterns of both breeds. Statistical mixed models were used to determine the effects of breed and season on all foraging response variables. Spatial regression analysis was used to examine resource utilization. Compared to AH, RC cows traveled farther at higher velocity rates, spent less time resting, more time grazing and traveling, explored larger areas as individuals, and exhibited lower herd cohesion. The RC herd explored more grazing patches (30-m pixel) overall and exhibited lower patch residence times in winter, a foraging strategy linked with lighter environmental footprint. During summer, similar pixel variables explained re-visitation rates of cows of both breeds. Both breeds avoided areas far from water, but RC cows showed higher avoidance of pixels farther out from a drinker during the dormant season. RC cows appeared to exhibit a keener ability to select patches with differing surface temperature, and greenness compared to AH counterparts. RC cows showed higher preference for pixels with high shrub density than AH counterparts in summer. During the dormant season, AH cows exhibited a strong preference for black grama patches, a species with high ecological value, and higher avoidance of patches with high density of other grasses. Differences in foraging behavior documented in this study support the hypothesis that RC cattle could impose a lighter footprint on desert rangeland relative to commonly raised commercial beef cattle. Topographical constraints, particularly steep slopes and far distances to water, have persistently challenged livestock distribution globally. Information gained from global positioning system (GPS) tracking devices have accelerated knowledge of cattle (Bos taurus) use of complex topography to potentially challenge established guidelines. In northern Wyoming, USA, we deployed 5 GPS collars on multiparous Salers cows with calves from July to November 2018\textendash 2019. Cattle rotated between 2 contrasting rangeland pastures: the Basin pasture (Foothills Shrublands and Low Mountains ecoregion; mean slope of 17.7\% (range: 0.87\textendash 111.01\%)) and Mountain pasture (transitioning to Absaroka-Gallatin Volcanic Mountain ecoregion; mean slope of 24.4\% (range: 0.26\textendash 125.11\%)). We estimated mean and maximum slope use and distances from water, along with daily distances traveled for each GPS-collared cow per pasture per year. We also generated utilization distributions with Brownian bridge movement models to compare mean slope and distances to water among quartiles of predicted use, and compared stocking rate adjustments per pasture between standard and GPS location derived methods. Mean daily distance traveled was 5126.5 km and 5011.6 km in the Basin and Mountain pastures, respectively, and average distance to water was {$<$}1.65 km. Cattle use was concentrated on gentler slopes than the average slope of the pasture. Mean and maximum slope use was 17.5\% (9.9\textdegree ) and 68.2\% (34.3\textdegree ) respectively in the Basin pasture and 8.9\% (5.1\textdegree ) and 57.1\% (29.7\textdegree ) in the Basin pasture. Compared to standard methods, GPS-derived grazeable area calculations suggested that there was less grazeable area in the Basin pasture but more in the Mountain pasture. Our results indicate that cattle adapted to mountainous terrain may challenge established guidelines for slope use, but not for distance to water. Such information could influence grazeable area calculations, stocking rates, and water development. Management of areas invaded by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) continues to be one of the greatest challenges for US Great Basin ecosystems. Targeted cattle grazing in the fall and winter has shown positive results as a management tool to reduce dormant fine fuel biomass within cheatgrass-invaded areas, but management of targeted grazing within large pastures can be challenging. We evaluated the use of strategically placed liquid protein supplement stations over a 4-wk period in the fall to focus cattle grazing along a linear transect stretching away from water to reduce residual cheatgrass biomass on a production-scale, working ranch from 2014 to 2017. Liquid protein supplement stations were moved approximately 1 km farther from water during each week of the study, eventually reaching 4 km from a single water source. Global Positioning System-tracked cattle visited supplement stations 52\% {$\pm$} 4\% of the days during the study period and were within 100 m of the supplement station transect line 17.7\% {$\pm$} 2.6\% of the time: more than 3 \texttimes{} greater (P = 0.07) than random locations (5.1\% {$\pm$} 2.6\%). Week of the study and the subsequent supplement distance from water did not influence the number of visits cattle made to supplement. The duration that cattle remained at supplement was greater in wk 4, when supplement was placed 4 km from water, compared with wk 1 and 2, when the supplement was 1 and 2 km from water, respectively. At the conclusion of grazing, utilization along the supplement station transect averaged 66.0\% {$\pm$} 5.7\% and did not differ between supplement stations at 1 km, 3 km, or 4 km from water. Strategic supplementation provides a valuable tool to target cattle grazing at specific locations within cheatgrass-invaded systems to reduce fine fuel buildup during the dormant season. A key challenge of precision grazing systems is identifying behavior anomalies associated with situations of reduced animal production and wellbeing. We determined typical ranges of diel variation of movement and activity patterns of steers on rangeland to identify metrics that could serve as sensitive indicators of behavior anomalies. Seventeen Raramuri Criollo or Criollo crossbred yearling steers weighing 318 {$\pm$} 9.3 kg (winter; W) or 358 {$\pm$} 8.4 kg (late summer; LS) were fitted with GPS collars that recorded animal location at 5-min intervals. Steers grazed a 3,215-ha rangeland pasture for approximately 67 d in W or LS of 2016 and 2017. GPS data were used to derive 22 commonly monitored behavior variables. Means and day-to-day variation (CV\%) of all behavior metrics were calculated for each animal as well as linear correlations between the CV of each behavior and ADG. Daily time spent resting or grazing exhibited the least day-to-day variation in both W and LS (CV resting =10.8 and 9.9\%, respectively; CV grazing =13.8 and 14.8\%, respectively); predawn area explored (CV =240.8\%) and time spent at drinkers (CV =336.6\%) exhibited the most daily variation in W and LS, respectively. During W, increasing day-to-day variation in daytime distance traveled and area explored, as well as daily time spent traveling were associated with increasing ADG (r = 0.56 to 0.58; P {$<$} 0.05). In LS, steers with greater CV for 24-h area explored, time spent traveling, or daytime distance traveled tended to gain less weight (r =-0.77 to -0.84; P {$<$} 0.01), while steers with more flexible 24 hour path sinuosity tended to gain more weight (r = 0.93; P {$<$} 0.01). Behavior metrics more closely associated with forage intake processes, such as daily time spent grazing or resting, exhibited lowest diel variation levels and could be used to diagnose non-normal behavior of cattle on rangeland. Livestock distribution in extensive rangelands of North America can present management challenges to land managers. Understanding the role of topography on livestock distribution, within and across diverse rangeland ecosystems, could provide land managers valuable information for adaptive management of livestock to address both conservation and production goals from these ecosystems. Here, we examine the influence of topography on grazing distribution unevenness and intensity of use of beef cattle in seven rangeland ecosystems spanning arid, semiarid, and subtropical environments. We focused on grazing distribution during the late growing season (summer and autumn) periods when topographic variation in rangelands is more coupled to low and nonuniform availability of high-quality forage. Pasture size and water sources strongly influence grazing distribution across ecosystems. High unevenness of grazing occurred in pastures with extensive distances to water, low stock density, and more rugged topography. Conversely, more uniform grazing distribution occurred in smaller, well-watered pastures that support higher stock density (animals per unit area) and gentler terrain. Comparison of two topographic indices, topographic wetness index and topographic position class index, in terms of their ability to predict cattle grazing distribution, revealed that categorical topographic position classes were more effective. For most arid and semiarid rangelands, livestock grazing distributions showed affinities for lowlands and flat plains compared with open slopes and uplands. In contrast to drier rangelands, livestock grazing distributions exhibited preference for upland and sloped areas of subtropical pastures, as low-lying areas with water-inundation likely curtailed selection. Across these diverse rangeland ecosystems of North America, results provide benchmark information on livestock grazing distribution to formulate improvements in adaptive management and decision making and incorporate technological advancements in precision livestock management to integrate abiotic environmental information with spatial movements of livestock and temporal vegetation dynamics. \textbullet Rangeland-based livestock raising is the only agricultural production system that maintains native plant communities, providing ecosystem services in the same space as food and fiber production.\textbullet Annual aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) underlies forage production and multiple ecosystem services. ANPP is highly variable in rangelands in the western United States, across the landscape, from year to year, and within a growing season. Variability is also increasing as the climate changes.\textbullet Grazing management decisions that determine when, where, and how much of ANPP is consumed by livestock, including stocking rate decisions, can ultimately determine rangeland health and the future sustainability of livestock production and provision of ecosystem services.\textbullet Yet managers' access to data on available forage and its variability is limited, and existing field methods to quantify forage production accurately require extensive sampling and are prone to errors or bias.\textbullet A variety of remotely sensed data sources exist to help characterize forage availability and how it has varied spatially and temporally over the last 30 or more years, as well as other datasets that can estimate available forage and inaccessible terrain for livestock.\textbullet We discuss the need for a state-of-the-art decision support tool that integrates available remote-sensing data on forage availability with land managers' knowledge of local needs and information for managers to access to the depth and breadth of information they need to sustainably manage grazing under variable and changing conditions.\textbullet Such a decision support tool could help land managers better manage rangeland ecosystems with flexible stocking rates and adaptive grazing management opportunities that adjust to variations in ANPP, leading to increased regional and site-specific rangeland resilience.},

  abstract = {Since 1959, the U.S. Congress has legislated the treatment and management of wild horses (Equus ferus caballus) and burros (E. asinus; WHB). While the legislation has ensured WHB a place as western rangeland icons, subsequent congressional actions, in response to public lobbying, have limited federal managers' ability to manage WHB populations under the U.S. public land multiple-use doctrine. Federal land managers tasked with managing for multiple and competing interests on public lands of the western United States must not only consider WHB habitat requirements, but also wildlife species diversity and livestock grazing. Developing multiple-use management strategies while fulfilling other mandates will require balancing rather than maximizing a single resource use or user. Grazing by wild and domestic animals can modify plant community composition and structure, and overabundant populations negatively impact rangeland\textendash watershed function and wildlife habitats. Negative effects on wildlife may include avoidance of water sources by wildlife, forage loss and altered plant communities, altered bird communities, and impacts to soils and insects. Effective management for riparian and rangeland health includes managing both the abundance and the distribution of large grazers. Unless large grazers (including WHB) are managed, range condition and wildlife habitat are at risk. While livestock can be moved and removed, and big game can be hunted, the management and removal of WHB populations continues to face strong public opposition. The management of WHB under the federal land multiple-use doctrine will require implementing innovative, diverse, and tough management strategies founded in the biological and social sciences. This special issue of Human\textendash Wildlife Interactions explores these issues in depth. This paper frames the context in which WHB management must be achieved under the U.S. public land multiple-use doctrine.},

  abstract = {To describe training loads during an Ironman training program based on intensity zones, and observe training-performance relationships. 9 triathletes completed a program with the same periodization model aiming at participation in the same Ironman event. Before and during the study, subjects performed ramp-protocol tests, running and cycling, to determine Aerobic (AeT) and Anaerobic Thresholds (AnT) through gas-exchange analysis. For swimming, subjects performed a graded lactate test to determine AeT and AnT. Training was subsequently controlled by heart rate during each training session over 18 weeks. Training and the competition were both quantified based on the cumulative time spent in 3 intensity zones: zone 1 (low intensity; AnT). Most of training time was spent in zone 1 (68{$\pm$}14\%) whereas the Ironman competition was primarily performed in zone 2 (59{$\pm$}22\%). Significant inverse correlations were found between both total training time and training time in zone 1 versus performance time in competition (r= -0.69, and -0.92, respectively). In contrast, there was a moderate positive correlation between total training time in zone 2 and performance time in competition (r=0.53) and a strong positive correlation between \% of total training time in zone 2 and performance time in competition (r=0.94). While athletes perform with heart rate mainly in zone 2, better performances are associated with more training time spent in zone 1. A high amount of cycling training in zone 2 may contribute to poorer overall performance.},

  abstract = {Landscape-scale information on animal density is being increasingly recognized as a fundamental parameter for enhancing wildlife conservation practices and management. It is important to obtain such information on forest ungulates because they have profound impacts on vegetation and also often constitute important prey for human hunters and large predators. In this study, we incorporated habitat covariates into a recently-developed likelihood-based approach (random encounter and staying time [REST] model) and test the potential of estimating the density and biomass of forest ungulates at landscape scales exclusively from camera traps. We targeted four duiker species (subfamily: Cephalophinae) in Central Africa and determined the effects of habitat covariates using Bayesian model averaging. The density of sympatric duikers largely varied across species, with each species exhibiting different spatial patterns; thus, sympatric duikers might exhibit space partitioning at the landscape scale. Topography might be a key factor determining spatial variation in duiker density, within and among species. Yet, total duiker biomass (kg) did not vary largely, and even remained high in naturally- and anthropogenically-disturbed forests; thus, disturbed forests may still be of value to human hunters and large predators. Through determining the habitat-density relationships, this study provides a novel approach for predicting animal density at landscape scales. Given the difficulty in implementing classic line-transect surveys in sloped areas, our approach might provide a viable way of estimating the density of ungulates occupying a wide variety of habitats.},

  abstract = {Population density estimations are essential for wildlife management and conservation. Camera traps have become a promising cost-effective tool, for which several methods have been described to estimate population density when individuals are unrecognizable (i.e. unmarked populations). However, comparative tests of their applicability and performance are scarce. Here, we have compared three methods based on camera traps to estimate population density without individual recognition: Random Encounter Model (REM), Random Encounter and Staying Time (REST) and Distance Sampling with camera traps (CT-DS). Comparisons were carried out in terms of consistency with one another, precision and cost-effectiveness. We considered six natural populations with a wide range of densities, and three species with different behavioural traits (red deer Cervus elaphus, wild boar Sus scrofa and red fox Vulpes vulpes). In three of these populations, we obtained independent density estimates as a reference. The densities estimated ranged from 0.23 individuals/km2 (fox) to 34.87 individuals/km2 (red deer). We did not find significant differences in terms of density values estimated by the three methods in five out of six populations, but REM has a tendency to generate higher average density values than REST and CT-DS. Regarding the independents' densities, REM results were not significantly different in any population, and REST and CT-DS were significantly different in one population. The precision obtained was not significantly different between methods, with average coefficients of variation of 0.28 (REST), 0.36 (REM) and 0.42 (CT-DS). The REST method required the lowest human effort. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that all of the methods examined can work well, with each having particular strengths and weaknesses. Broadly, Random Encounter and Staying Time (REST) could be recommended in scenarios of high abundance, Distance Sampling with camera traps (CT-DS) in those of low abundance while Random Encounter Model (REM) can be recommended when camera trap performance is not optimal, as it can be applied with less risk of bias. This broadens the applicability of camera trapping for estimating densities of unmarked populations using information exclusively obtained from camera traps. This strengthens the case for scientifically based camera trapping as a cost-effective method to provide reference estimates for wildlife managers, including within multi-species monitoring programmes.},

``his variation could be reduced using a stratified sampling design (Buckland et al., 2001; Rowcliffe et al., 2008), but this may be challenging in camera trapping studies because of the small sampling area covered by each camera; this means that encounter rate is more strongly influenced by microsite conditions than by larger-scale habitat characteristics that can be defined across wide areas and therefore used for pre-stratification.'' (Palencia et al., 2021, p. 1590)

``Eventually, a protocol equivalent to adaptive distance sampling surveys can be applied. It consists of conducting an additional survey effort in those sampling points where more animals are recorded, which is especially useful in populations distributed patchily and sparsely (Buckland, 2004).''

``Accordingly, to obtain a CV lower than 0.20, required for effective wildlife management (Williams et al., 2002), the effort with REM will be around 100 camera traps. Regarding CT-DS, Bessone et al.

``The REST method was the least-time consuming, mainly because not all the animals captured by the camera traps were considered in the analysis, only those that crossed the focal triangle of detection defined within the wider camera field of view.'' (Palencia et al., 2021, p. 1590)
\par
``CT-DS is the most time-consuming method, mainly because the exploratory analyses, goodness-of-fit testing and model selection are critical (Howe et al., 2019).'' (Palencia et al., 2021, p. 1590)

Managers are concerned about the impact of increased recreation on desert bighorn sheep in Canyonlands National Park (NP), Utah, USA, where visitation increased 325\% from 1979 to 1994. We compared behavioral responses of sheep to recreational activity between a low visitor use area and a high visitor use area during 1993 and 1994 by observing behavioral responses, distances moved, and duration of responses to vehicles, mountain bikers, and humans on foot. Hikers caused the most severe responses in desert bighorn sheep (animals fled in 61\% of encounters), followed by vehicles (17\% fled) and mountain bikers (6\% fled), apparently because hikers were more likely to be in unpredictable locations and often directly approached sheep. We observed considerable individual heterogeneity in responses of bighorn sheep to the greater human use: some animals lived close to the road corridor and were apparently habituated to the human activities, but other animals avoided the road corridor. In the high-use area, we observed 3 radiocollared sheep that lived closer to the road than expected and found evidence of fewer responses to vehicles by females in spring, less response time of all sheep to vehicles in spring, and fewer responses to mountain bikers compared to the low-use area. Overall, there was an avoidance of the road corridor by most other bighorn sheep in the high-use area where all animals, on average, were found 39\% farther from roads (490 {$\pm$} 19 m vs. 354 {$\pm$} 36 m) than in the low-use area. This avoidance of the road corridor by some animals represented 15\% less use of potential suitable habitat in the high-use area over the low-use area. Increased sensitivity to hikers in the high-use area was suggested by a greater responsiveness by males in autumn and greater distance fled by females in spring. Responses of bighorn sheep were greater when human activity approached at the same elevation, when sheep were moving or standing, when female interactions occurred in spring and summer and male interactions occurred in autumn, and when sheep were farther from escape terrain. We recommend managers confine hikers to designated trails during spring lambing and the autumn rut in desert bighorn sheep habitat.},

  abstract = {Since the 1800s managed grasslands and shrublands of the arid American Southwest have been grazed predominantly by cattle originally bred for temperate climates in northern Europe. A heritage breed, the criollo cattle, has survived in northern Mexico for more than 400 years under desert-like conditions of low and variable rainfall, hot temperatures in the growing season, and both spatially and temporally scarce levels of primary production. We tested the hypothesis that the heritage breed has a broader spatial foraging distribution under harsh environmental conditions, and that its distribution is driven by environmental variables which differ from those that control the distribution of the introduced European breed. Movements of individual criollo and Angus breed animals were monitored autonomously in the northern Chihuahuan desert of southern New Mexico, USA. Georeferenced foraging locations acquired at 5-minute intervals for each animal were fit to a logistic regression using environmental factors as predictors. In the spring, when forage availability was high and more uniformly distributed across the landscape, animal foraging patterns were similar for both breeds. In the fall when forage availability was low and non-uniformly distributed, the two breeds exhibited very different foraging patterns: heritage animals foraged across a much larger spatial extent whereas their domestic counterparts remained in close proximity to the permanent source of water. These differences in foraging behavior driven by environmental variables have important implications for sustainability of rangelands in spatially and temporally variable environments. Heritage breeds of animals that are generalist foragers during unfavorable conditions can reduce environmental impacts compared to more recently introduced breeds.},

The grazing seasons, in replicate pastures, were from 15 July-9 August, 15 June-26 July, and 15 June-2 August in 1980,1981, and 1982, respectively. Daily observations were made of radio-telemetry collared cattle (3 per pasture). Cattle dispersion was constrained by the spatial distribution of water and slope. Across 3 seasons, 77\% of observed use was within 366 m of water. Approximately 65\% of the land area WPSbeyond 723 m from water and sustained only 12\% of observed use. Cattle concentrated use (79\%) on slopes less than 7\%. Consequently 35\% of the area, on or surrounded by slopes {$>$}lO\%, received only 7\% of observed use. Loamy, grszable woodland and wetlandfsubirrigated range sites were most preferred and accounted for over 65\% of observed use while occupying less than 35\% of the land area. Overall, course upland, very shallow and shallow loamy sites were not preferred; however, site preference varied as areas further from water were utilized. Observed usewassigniticantly (P},

Rangeland health assessments consist of evaluating how well ecological processes, such as the water cycle, energy flow, and nutrient cycling, are functioning at a site. Maintained ecological functions provide support for specific plant and animal communities (Pellant et al. 2005) and ensure a flow of ecosystem services. The most commonly used protocol to assess US rangelands has become the Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health (IIRH) assessment (Pellant et al. 2005; Pyke et al. 2002). Rangeland health assessments use 17 indicators to rate 3 attributes of rangeland health that integrate soil and plant indicators together with other abiotic factors into one scientifically tested assessment tool. Attributes rated as part of rangeland health assessments are soil and site stability, hydrologic function, and biotic integrity (Pellant et al. 2005). Additionally, rangeland health protocols have been tested across a broad range of ecosystems and are already in use by thousands of individuals worldwide. Other common tools used to evaluate rangelands include similarity indices and trend studies, which can be used alone or in conjunction with the rangeland health assessment methodology.

  abstract = {Year-round mixed-species grazing at low densities in large-scale pasture systems has become a popular conservation concept as it is assumed to maintain the valuable biodiversity of semi-open cultural landscapes. This study aims to elucidate which vegetation types are preferentially grazed by cattle and sheep and whether the grazing animals change their preferences through the seasons so that year-round grazing leads to a utilization of all habitats. Additionally, we wanted to determine the main factors underlying the site use patterns of the animals. The study was conducted on 180ha of a nature reserve and former military training area in northern Germany from January to October. Within this area, the positions of one cattle herd and one sheep flock were simultaneously recorded every 5min using the global positioning system (GPS). For this purpose, we fitted one GPS collar alternately to three different cows and another to three different sheep. If the position of a collared animal had changed more than 6m but less than 100m within 5min grazing was assumed based on a validation of these thresholds by direct observation. Using a geographic information system, we analysed the location data with regard to vegetation characteristics, altitude, and distance from fences, water sources, and a sheep shed. For each month, we determined Ivlev's electivity index of both herbivore species in relation to eight broad vegetation types. We used multiple linear regression to create models that describe the grazing frequencies in the grid cells of the area depending on parameters of those grid cells and their spatial position. Cattle preferred moist and productive habitats, whereas sheep preferred dry and nutrient-poor habitats. Only when feed was in extremely short supply, the animals switched to sites they had previously avoided. Differences in the spatial preferences of the two species were more marked than seasonal changes. Spatial demands of cattle and sheep were largely complementary. Grazing sites with better water availability (i.e. lower distance from the drinking trough and ponds) were significantly preferred by cattle. The sheep preferred grazing sites close to their shed. Our results show that only a combination of different herbivores guarantees that all habitats of such a large low-intensity pasture are grazed and thus are kept in a management status favourable to conservation. However, the positioning of drinking troughs, fences, and sheds should be carefully considered as these facilities seriously influence the site use of the animals.},

  abstract = {1. Competition between livestock and wild ungulates is commonly perceived to occur on shared rangelands. In the Henry Mountains (HM) of Utah, a free-ranging population of bison Bison bison has raised concerns among ranchers holding grazing permits on these public lands. Bison are the most conspicuous potential competitors with cattle, but lagomorphs (mainly jackrabbits Lepus californicus) are also abundant in this area. The local ranching community is applying political pressure on state and federal agencies to resolve 'the bison problem', but the relative grazing impacts of bison, cattle and lagomorphs have not previously been quantified. 2. We constructed 40 grazing exclosures (each 5-95 m{$^2$}) in the conflict area: 20 excluded bison + cattle ('partial') and 20 excluded bison + cattle 4-lagomorphs ('full'). All exclosures, each with a paired open reference plot, were monitored for 1 year, and above-ground plant production was measured. GPS telemetry (bison) and scheduled grazing (cattle) allowed visitation to be quantified for each ungulate species based on the number of 'animal days' in the area. Rancher perceptions of wildlife-cattle interactions were recorded in a questionnaire survey. 3. Ranchers perceived bison as a high-level competitor with cattle, whereas lagomorphs were perceived as low-level competitors. 4. Grazed reference plots yielded an average ({$\pm$} SE) of 22{$\cdot$}7 g m{$^{-2}$} ({$\pm$} 5{$\cdot$}16) of grass, compared to 36{$\cdot$}5 g m{$^{-2}$} ({$\pm$} 7{$\cdot$}33) in the partial exclosures and 43{$\cdot$}7 g m{$^2$} ({$\pm$} 7{$\cdot$}61) in the full exclosures. Exclusion of large herbivores thus resulted in a 13{$\cdot$}8 g {$^{-2}$} increase in grass biomass relative to the reference plots (P = 0005), with the additional exclusion of lagomorphs resulting in a further 7{$\cdot$}18 g m{$^{-2}$} increase (P = 0-048). 5. Overall, lagomorphs accounted for 341\%, bison 13-7\% and cattle 52-3\% of the total grass biomass removed by all herbivores on the shared range. 6. Synthesis and applications. Cattle face a greater competitive challenge from lagomorphs than from bison in the study area. This case study illustrates the need for science-based management of social-ecological systems in which even long-term resource users might underestimate the complexities of trophic interactions. Attention should be redirected at the lagomorphs and their main predators, coyotes Canis latrans, which are currently subject to population control. To reduce negative perceptions among local ranchers, options should be explored to incorporate benefit-sharing into the management of the bison population.},

  abstract = {Improper management of cattle near streams can negatively affect the processes that support stream and riparian ecosystems. To judge the success of riparian management strategies, public land management agencies often evaluate two metrics of livestock disturbance, stubble height and streambank alteration. There are concerns associated with how well these disturbance metrics reflect livestock use and incorporate additional effects due to wild ungulates. We sought to address these questions in 39 riparian areas by using time-lapse cameras to estimate ungulate use and then measuring near stream ungulate disturbance in these same reaches. We found daytime measures of livestock use were related to stubble height and streambank alteration. Explaining the variation in the relationship between stubble height and livestock use was improved by incorporating covariates, whereas covariates did little to improve our understanding of streambank alteration. This suggests greater flexibility in how different stream reaches are managed when stubble height is the guideline. As streambank alteration was explained solely by ungulate use, the simplest way to reduce disturbance was to reduce use. In most stream reaches, the additive presence of wild ungulates was minimal but sufficient to be included in the best models describing the effects of ungulate disturbance. On most days, no cattle were seen in the evaluated riparian reaches. Although large groups of cattle ({$>$} 20 individuals) were occasionally observed within riparian areas, they generally occurred in small groups of one to four individuals. Across the riparian reaches we evaluated, cattle presence and density were generally low enough that metrics of livestock disturbance suggested little risk to stream conditions important to aquatic biota. However, there were some riparian areas where cattle stayed too long or occurred in large enough numbers that their use along the streambanks could negatively affect stream habitat conditions.},

The study was conducted on semidesert rangeland in south-central New Mexico. Ambient air temperatures ranged between 7 and 38\textdegree C. Relative humidity ranged between 15 and 91\%, with precipitation 49\% above the long-term January\textendash August mean of 147 mm. Four lactating and 4 non-lactating cows were fed an average of 1.4 kg per head day-1 of a 41\% crude protein cottonseed supplement every 3.5 days. Ten similar non-supplemented cows, 5 lactating and 5 non-lactating, were grazed with the supplemented animals in paddocks averaging {$>$}2000 ha in size. To monitor travel, the 18 cows were each bi-pedometered with digital pedometers attached to their front legs. The least square mean travel ({$\pm$} standard error) over the 81-day study period indicated supplemented and non-supplemented cows traveled similar (P{$>$}0.05) distances of 7.7{$\pm$}0.7 and 7.9{$\pm$}0.7 km day-1, respectively. Lactating and non-lactating cows likewise traveled similar (P{$>$}0.05) distances of 7.6{$\pm$}0.7 and 8.2{$\pm$}0.7 km day-1, respectively. Daylight ranged between 14.2 and 13.2 h throughout the study with daily travel decreasing (P{$<$}0.01) at a rate of 0.06{$\pm<$}0.01 km day-1. Mean daily cow travel was positively correlated (P{$<$}0.01) to both total amount of precipitation received (r=0.37) and mean hours of daylight (r=0.35) during the period in which travel was monitored. Mean daily cow travel was negatively correlated (r=-0.21; P{$<$}0.05) to mean daily relative humidity of the previous sampling period. However, mean daily cow travel was not (P{$>$}0.05) correlated to mean relative humidity of the period in which travel was monitored or to total amount of precipitation received during the previous sampling period.

Distribution patterns of horses were compared to those of cattle, elk (Cervus elaphus), deer (Odocoileus hemionus and 0. virginianus), and moose (Afces alces) using indices of spatial and habitat use overlap. Horses were more ubiquitous in their distribution than any other ungulate and utilized sites also used by other species. Lack of behavioural interactions and dietary differences suggested ecological separation of horses from deer and moose. Although horses and elk both used dry grasslands during winter and spring, competition for forage was minimal due to the low number of elk present. During spring horses occupied some areas later preferred by cattle but range use was not excessive prior to the turn-out of cattle. There was little contemporaneous spatial overlap of horses and cattle even though their summer diets showed 66\% overlap. Potential for competition appeared highest between horses and cattle but grazing relationships were complex.},

This paper examines the animal unit as an example of a general process of concept design, a process involving multiple options for defining the concept, and multiple objectives and multiple applications for the concept in range management science. Based on this analysis, the animal unit is abstracted as a unit of energy demand independent of interactive considerations of forage or environment. The proposed definition optimizes the utility and universality of the concept by minimizing confounding in the concept's most important applications. The result is a simplified concept that can be used to explicitly express animal equivalences, and can be used in a web of more complex, interactive concepts and models involving human objectives, natural resources, and livestock. The animal unit and animal-unit equivalent are relatively simple examples of synthetic concepts involving communication that are central to the identity of range management science.},

  abstract = {Wild horse (Equus ferus caballus) management in western North America is an escalating concern for ecological integrity on these landscapes. Identifying potential diet overlap among horses, livestock, and wildlife will inform management decisions to optimize multiple interests. To understand dietary relationships, we conducted a quantitative synthesis of microhistological fecal studies for wild horse, beef cattle (Bos spp.), domestic sheep (Ovis aries), elk (Cervus elaphus), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) diet composition on western rangelands of North America. Our search yielded 60 studies from 14 states, 1 Canadian province, and 2 Mexican states with 392 unique species-season samples. We summarized plant species into graminoid, forb, and browse functional groups. For wild horses, seasonal diet composition means for graminoids (77-89\%), forbs (4-15\%), and browse (3-10\%) did not vary seasonally for any plant group (P {$\leq$} 0.05). Univariate analyses and the calculation of effect sizes corroborated our finding that graminoid composition explained the potential overlap of wild horses with cattle regardless of season, with sheep and elk in the spring, with sheep in the summer, and with elk in the fall and winter. Although data indicate wild horse diets are primarily composed of graminoids, several studies reported unusual, regionally specific shifts in response to winter snow that limited graminoid accessibility, leading to higher browse composition. Season, plant composition, and ungulate assemblage may all influence dietary competition between wild horses and other large ungulate sharing western North American rangelands; however, the low and nonsignificant heterogeneity values at alpha 0.01 for cattle:horse effect size comparisons suggest that cattle and horses respond to regional and seasonal variation similarly\textemdash a result not observed for other ungulate:horse comparisons. Our meta-analysis provides a robust data set for evaluations of diet composition for wild horses, livestock, and wildlife, whereas no empirical studies have assessed all species together.},

  abstract = {Diet composition of free-roaming animals has been persistently difficult to quantify. Fecal DNA (fDNA) metabarcoding is an emerging novel technology to reconstruct botanical composition of diets. Validation studies comparing fDNA metabarcodion to fed diets are lacking. A blind 6-week feeding study using 5 heifers (416\textendash 527 kg) fed different diets weekly with fecal samples collected from individuals 7 days after the introduction of each new diet was conducted. Diets were: (1) C3 grass hay (creeping meadow foxtail (Alopecurus arundinaceus)), (2) C4 grass hay (foxtail millet (Setaria italica), (3) C3 grass hay + C4 grass hay + alfalfa hay (Medicago sativa) (equal 1/3 proportions dry matter, 17.0\%, 30.5\%, and 52.5\% by crude protein contribution, respectively), (4) C3 grass hay + C4 grass hay + alfalfa hay (equal proportions) + minor component of Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) leaves (fed at 25 grams per heifer per day equal to 0.29\% by dry matter contribution; crude protein content unknown), (5) alfalfa hay + minor components of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) that included steams, leaves, and seed heads (varying proportions by dry matter ranging from 0.02 to 0.15\% but 0.05\%, 0.04\%, and 0.01\% by crude protein contribution), and (6) alfalfa hay. Single species diets were fed ad libitum. Diets with multiple forage species were fed at metabolic weight-based amounts with minor diet components introduced 2-3 days after major diet components. At the species level, fed diets and fDNA metabarcoding diets were dissimilar due to misidentification of major C3 and C4 diet components. For C3, A. arundinaceus was under the same Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) as Phleum pratense (not present in the C3 sourced hay), so blind identification was initially wrong. For C4, S. italica was identified as Setaria palmifolia, which does not grow in the region. Microscopic evaluation of seeds for both misidentifications verified the correct species identification and the fDNA error. Minor dietary components were detected in only 1 of 5 heifers for all species. Increasing the utility of fDNA metabarcoding for accurately determining the diet composition of free-roaming animals will necessitate: 1) improving the reference library of voucher species specimens, 2) understanding by technical and scientific staff that multiple species may be attributed to the same OTU, and 3) greater verification of fDNA metabarcoding results using field-derived plant composition data, especially in rangeland settings where plant diversity can be intrinsically high.},

  abstract = {More than a quarter of earth's land surface is used for grazing domestic livestock. Livestock grazing is generally assumed to negatively affect wildlife, however, a number of studies have found positive impacts as well. We conducted an evidence-based review of the existing literature using a series of livestock- and wildlife-related search words to systematically query Google Scholar and Web of Science. A total of 807 sources were included in the final list, including 646 primary sources which reported original data. The majority of studies were conducted in North America (338) or Europe (123), with many fewer from Africa (57), Australia (54), Central/South America (43), or Asia (31). Most studies examined birds (330) and mammals (262), with fewer including reptiles (91) or amphibians (58). We extracted further information from studies that included mammals on positive, negative, and neutral effects of livestock grazing on mammals. We found that livestock change vegetation structure and cover in ways important to small mammals, while ungulates may be affected more by interference competition and changes in forage quantity and quality. Community-level total abundance of small mammals typically declines with grazing. Species richness of small mammals either declines or stays the same, as many studies found a change in species composition from ungrazed to grazed sites while the number of species remained similar. Individual species responses of small mammals vary. Voles, harvest mice, cotton rats, and shrews show consistently negative responses to grazing while deer mice, kangaroo rats, ground squirrels, and lagomorphs show positive or variable responses. In general, species adapted to open habitats are often positively affected by grazing, while species needing denser cover are negatively affected. Studies of wild ungulates are more variable in methodology and quality than those for small mammals. We found more negative (n = 86) than positive (n = 34) ungulate responses overall, however, most studies have been on browsers and mixed feeders, namely deer and elk, and there is little available data for other groups. Although data is limited, several of the grazing species in Africa may show a trend toward positive responses, suggesting possible facilitation. For a number of species, responses varied by season. We find a strong need for additional research on ungulates of varying diets and body sizes, especially in the developing world, and across longer time scales to examine possible tradeoffs between competition and facilitation from livestock.},

  abstract = {Grazing itineraries of herded and free grazing cattle (n=194), goats (n=148), and sheep (n=129) were monitored in a village territory over a 1-year cycle by direct observation of grazing and excretion behaviour and by parallel animal tracking using a Global Positioning System. During the study period, standing and litter biomass of spontaneous vegetation and crop residues was measured repeatedly on sample plots of fields (n=16), fallows (n=15) and rangeland (n=8). Based on a land use map, a Geographic Information System on forage availability was produced for the territory and overlaid with the livestock grazing itineraries. The animals' behaviour at pasture was related to the forage mass encountered along their daily itineraries in order to analyse the spatial variation in behaviour as influenced by season, livestock species and herd management mode. Maximum daily itinerary lengths were 25km in cattle, 20km in goats and 21km in sheep; itinerary length varied significantly between species, herd management modes and season. Animals spent between 456 and 625min per day on pasture, the grazing day of cattle being longer than that of sheep and goats. Across seasons, all three species spent on average about 60\% of the daily grazing time feeding, 20\textendash 26\% walking and 12\textendash 20\% resting. The forage mass encountered along the animals' itineraries was higher than the average amount of forage available in the area. Particularly during the late dry and the rainy season, herding increased the amount of forage on offer to grazing livestock. Throughout the year, 39\% of the observed excretions occurred on cropland, 31\% on rangeland, 20\% on fallows and 10\% in and around settlements; the spatial repartition of excreta deposits differed between herded and free grazing animals, with free grazing animals depositing a higher share of excretions on barren land. The obtained information on the variation of grazing and excretion behaviour with respect to ruminant species, land use type, forage supply, season and herd management can be coupled with quantitative data on feed intake and excreta deposition, in order to compute livestock-mediated nutrient budgets for Sahelian agro-pastoral land use systems.},

Bycatch data pooled from multiple studies can answer secondary research questions; however, variation in field and data management techniques creates problems when pooling data from multiple sources. Multi-collaborator projects that use standardized methods to answer broad-scale research questions are rare and limited in geographical scope. Many small, fixed-term independent camera trap studies operate in poorly represented regions, often using field and data management methods tailored to their own objectives. Inconsistent data management practices lead to loss of bycatch data, or an inability to share it easily. As a case study to illustrate common problems that limit use of bycatch data, we discuss our experiences processing bycatch data obtained by multiple research groups during a range-wide assessment of sun bears Helarctos malayanus in Southeast Asia. We found that the most significant barrier to using bycatch data for secondary research was the time required, by the owners of the data and by the secondary researchers (us), to retrieve, interpret and process data into a form suitable for secondary analyses. Furthermore, large quantities of data were lost due to incompleteness and ambiguities in data entry. From our experiences, and from a review of the published literature and online resources, we generated nine recommendations on data management best practices for field site metadata, camera trap deployment metadata, image classification data and derived data products. We cover simple techniques that can be employed without training, special software and Internet access, as well as options for more advanced users, including a review of data management software and platforms. From the range of solutions provided here, researchers can employ those that best suit their needs and capacity. Doing so will enhance the usefulness of their camera trap bycatch data by improving the ease of data sharing, enabling collaborations and expanding the scope of research.},

``Camera traps are widely used for small fixed-term surveys in areas of conservation signifi- cance to collect baseline data, often with loose or unde- fined objectives. Parallel to the increase in camera trap studies, the volume of `bycatch' data (i.e. images collected incidentally, and unrelated to the study's objectives) has increased steadily. When combined over multiple sites, bycatch data can reveal landscape scale macro-ecological patterns across space and time, and can aid in the research of understudied threatened species (Heffernan 2014; McShea et al. 2016).''

``1. Adopt a standardized, non-proprietary and transferrable data storage format to store all camera trap data'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 5)
\par
``In our case study, most of the data contributors used \\
Microsoft Excel to store data. Without requiring signifi- \\
cant training in relational database design, this tool is \\
preferred by many researchers (Herold 2015). A major \\
drawback, however, is that Excel is a proprietary, non- \\
transferable format, notoriously unreliable as this tool \\
can invisibly interpret and change entered data (e.g. \\
drop leading ``0s and change character strings to Julian \\
dates).'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 5) Another reason to avoid Excel.

``If using Excel, Borer et al. (2009) recommend storing all data in non-proprietary software formats, such as comma separated value (.csv) files, which can be viewed and manipulated in Excel.'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 5)
\par
``There are several advantages to storing data in open source non-proprietary relational database systems such as PostgreSQL or SGLite, or ecology specific tools such as ECOLOG (www.ecolog.sourceforge.net/index\_e.htm). \\
These formats are available without license fees, are not controlled by developers (e.g. Microsoft), and have wide online communities of users which collectively serve as a crowdsourced online help forum. These formats work across many different operating platforms, are operated with Structured Query Language (SQL), a standard lan- guage for relational database management systems, and store data in a format that is transferable to a new sys- tem or software.'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 5)
\par
``2. Accompany all spreadsheets with structured metadata'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 5)
\par
``Metadata, which give descriptive information about the content, context and structure of data, should accompany all raw data. When possible, use a standard metadata format, such as the EML, a metadata standard, developed by the ecology dis- cipline for the ecology discipline. EML is a pre-designed method that can facilitate efficient data sharing. EML works so that the data created in, for example, the soft- ware Morpho, a free program for storing, cataloguing, querying and editing metadata, can be easily ingested into other platforms that are programmed to anticipate the EML data structure (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/\# tools/morpho).'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 5)

standard specific to camera trap data, which is compatible \\
with EML and other industry standards.'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 5) Is this Camera Trap Metadata Standard? Look up citation

``At a minimum, researchers should create and provide a `ReadMe' file that describes why the data were collected, including objec- tives, methodology, database metadata, definitions of all co-variates, codes and acronyms, point of contact, owner- ship, rules of use and instructions for acknowledgement. \\
A freely available template, developed by the University of Minnesota Libraries, can be found here: https://z.umn.ed u/readme.'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 5)

``3. Record data at the highest possible resolution'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 5)
\par
``McGill (2016) suggests using an instance-row/variable-column format, in which each measurement has one row, and each column is a dif- ferent variable or attribute.'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``At minimum, researchers should record the start and end time and date each cam- era trap was active. This information will allow users to determine camera-specific measures of sampling effort (i.e. number of trap nights), which is preferable to an average measure of effort across all cameras on a site.'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``TEAM provide a list of data quality control measures for camera trap data, which includes recommendations on sampling effort (i.e. number of units, trapping periods) and maintaining data quality (ac- cess here: www.teamnetwork.org/files/protocols/terrestrial- vertebrate/TEAM\_Terrestrial\_Vertebrates\_Data\_Quality\_ Standards.pdf).'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``4. Use a clearly documented and consistent geographic coordinate system'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``Providing accurate and identifiable Global Positioning System (GPS) locations with your data is critical. In our case study, missing or ambiguous latitude and longitude data were the most persistent issue leading to loss of data'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``Camera trap deployment metadata should be relatable to an exact geographic location. The large num- ber of geographical and projected coordinate systems available within Global Information Systems (GIS), (i.e. \\
GPS units and mapping software) makes it critical to record the coordinate datum that points are collected in the field (e.g. Indian Thailand Datum). Data collected without an accurate geographic location are of limited use, and may require significant time to process by sec- ondary researchers. A single coordinate system (e.g. Geo- graphic Coordinate WGS 1984) should be used consistently within each stage of collection, entry and processing of data. If changes to the coordinate system are required, they should be carefully documented. Store GPS coordinates in a format easily read and transformed by a GIS (i.e. numbers only; avoid placing letters or sym- bols within the same cell as geographic coordinates: doing so requires manual editing.'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``Whatever system is used, also report locations in decimal degrees out to 5 decimal places, plac- ing the location within 1-metre accuracy and avoiding ambiguities with incomplete Universal Transverse Merca- tor (UTM) coordinates and studies that straddle more than one UTM zone. Include information on map datums, UTM Zones and geographic coordinate systems within the field metadata. If possible, researchers should label and store each camera trap location in GPS units (keeping hand written locations as a backup), rather than record and transcribe GPS locations from datasheets.'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``5. Maintain a consistent date-time format'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``Researchers should include dates of camera operation (start date, end date), and date and time of individual pictures in the deployment metadata.'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``Data managers should choose a date system, specify it clearly in the col- umn heading and/or metadata and stick to it consistently within a dataset. An example of a well-defined date sys- tem is 2011-09-14 00:23:33 (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss).'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``6. Record covariate data that might be used to assess detection probability'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``An inability to account for differences in detection prob- ability can lower the value of bycatch data. Therefore, researchers should record factors that influence detection probability (e.g. season, habitat type, height of vegetation and tree density) in the field metadata (Rowcliffe and Carbone 2008; Nichols 2010).'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)
\par
``Likewise, in the deploy- ment metadata, include factors that influence species- specific detection probability (e.g. camera trap model, settings, position, date and time of day).'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)

``However, given the multiple factors that can influence detection probability from camera-trap data, it is unlikely that researches using by-catch data, particularly from many small fixed- term studies, will be able to collect sufficient and consis- tent information for accurately modelling detection'' (Scotson et al., 2017, p. 9)

image classification and derived data products in a central \\

  abstract = {The relative importance of cottonwood-willow riparian corridors and isolated oases to land birds migrating across southeastern Arizona was evaluated during four spring migrations, 1989 to 1994, based on patterns of species richness, relative abundance, density, and body condition of birds. We surveyed birds in 13 study sites ranging in size and connectivity from small isolated patches to extensive riparian forest, sampled vegetation and insects, and captured birds in mistnets. The continuous band of riparian vegetation along the San Pedro River does not appear to be functioning as a corridor for many migrating species, although it may for a few, namely Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens), Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra), and Northern Rough-winged Swallows (Steldigopteryx serripennis), which account for fewer than 10\% of the individuals migrating through the area. Small, isolated oases hosted more avian species than the corridor sites, and the relative abundances of most migrating birds did not differ between sites relative to size-connectivit. There were few differences in between-year variability in the relative abundances of migrating birds between corridor and oasis sites. Between-year variability decreased with overall abundance of species and was greater for species with breeding ranges that centered north of 50 \textsuperscript{{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}}N latitude. Body condition of birds did not differ relative to the size-connectivity of the capture site, but individuals of species with more northerly breeding ranges had more body fat than species that breed nearby. Peak migration densities of several bird species far exceeded breeding densities reported for the San Pedro River, suggesting that large components of these species were en route migrants. Peak densities of Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia) reached 48.0 birds/ha, of Wilson's Warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) 33.7 birds/ha, and of Yellow-rumped Warblers (D. coronata) 30.1 birds/ha. Riparian vegetation is limited in extent in the vicinity of our study sites, covering less than 1\% of the landscape. We conclude that all riparian patches in southeastern Arizona are important as stopover sites to en route migrants regardless of their size and degree of isolation or connectivity. In light of potential habitat limitation, the protection of both small, disjunct riparian patches and extensive riverine tracts in western landscape is imperative.},

The continuous band of riparian vegetation along the San Pedro River does not appear to be functioning as a corridor for many migrating species, although it may for a few, namely Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens), Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra), and Northern Rough-winged Swallows (Steldigopteryx serripennis), which account for fewer than 10\% of the individuals migrating through the area. Small, isolated oases hosted more avian species than the corridor sites, and the relative abundances of most migrating birds did not differ between sites relative to size-connectivit. There were few differences in between-year variability in the relative abundances of migrating birds between corridor and oasis sites. Between-year variability decreased with overall abundance of species and was greater for species with breeding ranges that centered north of 50 \textsuperscript{{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}}N latitude. Body condition of birds did not differ relative to the size-connectivity of the capture site, but individuals of species with more northerly breeding ranges had more body fat than species that breed nearby. Peak migration densities of several bird species far exceeded breeding densities reported for the San Pedro River, suggesting that large components of these species were en route migrants. Peak densities of Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia) reached 48.0 birds/ha, of Wilson's Warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) 33.7 birds/ha, and of Yellow-rumped Warblers (D. coronata) 30.1 birds/ha. Riparian vegetation is limited in extent in the vicinity of our study sites, covering less than 1\% of the landscape. We conclude that all riparian patches in southeastern Arizona are important as stopover sites to en route migrants regardless of their size and degree of isolation or connectivity. In light of potential habitat limitation, the protection of both small, disjunct riparian patches and extensive riverine tracts in western landscape is imperative.},

To explore the effects of species biogeography and habitat affinity on spring migration patterns, we synthesized existing bird abundance and capture data collected in riparian habitats of the borderlands region of the U.S. and Mexico. We determined the importance of geographic factors (longitude and latitude) in explaining variation in abundances and capture rates of 32 longdistance and three short-distance migrant species. Abundances and capture rates of 13 and 11 species, respectively, increased with increasing longitude, and four species' abundance and capture rates decreased with increasing longitude. Riparian associates, but not nonriparian species, were more abundant in western sites. Their abundance patterns were only weakly influenced by species biogeography. In contrast, biogeography did influence abundance patterns of nonriparian birds, suggesting that they choose the shortest, most direct route between wintering and breeding areas. We hypothesize that riparian obligate birds may, to some degree, adjust their migration routes to maximize time spent in high-quality riparian zones, but they are able to find suitable habitat opportunistically when crossing more hostile landscapes. In contrast, nonriparian birds adhere more closely to a hierarchical model in which the migratory route is determined by biogeographic constraints. Conservation of riparian habitats is necessary to meet future habitat stopover requirements of many western Neotropical migrant birds. We advocate a coordinated research effort to further elucidate patterns of distribution and habitat use so that conservation activities can be focused effectively.},

The efficiency, cost effectiveness and risk with which rainfall is converted into plant production, and eventually gross farming income, without deterioration of natural resources form the essence of sustainability of rangeland ecosystems in these areas. Range and soil degradation can dramatically influence soil water balance, nutrient cycling, soil loss, production and the economics of a farm unit. Management for long-term sustainability often requires sacrifice of short-term welfare. With respect to deterioration and loss of productivity of natural vegetation, a co-ordinated approach is needed towards establishing a comprehensive inventory of the condition of national vegetation resources on a geographically and scientifically sound basis.},

  abstract = {Large grazers are essential for nature conservation. In order to prevent grazers from moving to unintended areas, it may be necessary to keep them inside enclosures. Physical fences present a number of problems, such as fragmenting the landscape. Virtual fencing, however, is a possible replacement for physical fencing, making it possible to enclose grazers without physical boundaries. Virtual fencing systems utilise collars with GPS technology to track animals and deliver auditory warnings and electric impulses to keep animals within predefined boundaries. This study examines how effective the virtual fencing system Nofence\textcopyright{} is at enclosing calves in a holistically managed setting. Holistic management is a rotational grazing technique where an enclosure is grazed in small strips at a time. It is investigated whether the calves become habituated to the virtual fence and whether there is a correlation between the number of warnings received by every two calves in order to explore potential herd behaviour. Finally, this study examines which calves interact the most with the virtual fence by investigating the relationship between physical activity and number of interactions. Seventeen calves were fitted with a GPS collar from the company Nofence\textcopyright{} and placed in a holistically managed enclosure. Data were gathered from 4 July to 30 September 2022. The study found that virtual fence was able to contain calves inside the designated enclosure, and over time the calves received notably fewer electrical impulses compared to auditory warnings. The results of Pearson's correlation between auditory warnings received by two random calves were inconclusive, but the use of a sliding window analysis should be further explored. Lastly, the most physically active animals were the ones who received the most auditory warnings, but they did not receive more impulses. No significant correlation was found between the number of electric impulses received and the physical activity of the animals.},

  abstract = {Many studies on the coexistence of wildlife with livestock have focused primarily on similar-sized species. Furthermore, many of these studies have used dietary overlap as a measure of potential competition between interacting species and thus lack the important link between dietary overlap and any negative effects on a particular species\textendash a prerequisite for competition. Consequently, the mechanisms that drive interspecific interactions between wildlife and cattle are frequently overlooked. To address this, we used an experimental setup where we leveraged different cattle stocking rates across two seasons to identify the drivers of interspecific interactions (i.e. competition and facilitation) between smaller-bodied oribi antelope and cattle. Using direct foraging observations, we assessed dietary overlap and grass regrowth, and also calculated oribi nutritional intake rates. Ultimately, we found that cattle compete with, and facilitate, smaller-bodied oribi antelope through bottom-up control. Specifically, cattle facilitated oribi during the wet season, irrespective of cattle stocking density, because cattle foraging produced high-quality grass regrowth. In contrast, during the dry season, cattle and oribi did not co-exist in the same areas (i.e. no direct dietary overlap). Despite this, we found that cattle foraging at high densities during the previous wet season reduced the dry season availability of oribi's preferred grass species. To compensate, oribi expanded their dry season diet breadth and included less palatable grass species, ultimately reducing their nutritional intake rates. Thus, cattle competed with oribi through a delayed, across-season habitat modification. We show that differences in body size alone may not be able to offset competitive interactions between cattle and wildlife. Finally, understanding the mechanisms that drive facilitation and competition are key to promoting co-existence between cattle and wildlife.},

  abstract = {Growing wolf (Canis lupus L.) populations in the US Rocky Mountain Region have increased conflicts between livestock production and wolf conservation. Given that the costs of large carnivore conservation are disproportionately borne by local livestock producers, the United States uses compensation for wolf damage to reduce conflicts and mediate negative attitudes toward the predators. Current compensation programs, however, only consider the direct effects of wolf predation. Indirect effects, such as wolf effects on weaning weights, and conception rates, may also reduce profitability. By not including indirect wolf effects, compensation programs may systematically undercompensate ranchers. We use a stochastic budget model of a representative cow\textendash calf ranch in northwest Wyoming to estimate the economic impact of both direct (death loss and injured calves) and indirect effects (decreased weaning weights, decreased conception rates, and increased cattle sickness) of wolf predation. Our results suggest that short-run (i.e., year-to-year) financial impacts of wolf indirect effects may be as large as or larger than the direct effects. Including indirect effects implies that the compensation ratio (i.e., number of calves compensated per confirmed depredation) necessary to fully offset the financial impacts of wolves would need to be two to three times larger than current 7:1 compensation ratio used in Wyoming.},

We tested the hypothesis that those three species would exhibit little overlap in diet and that mule deer, the smallest in body size of the three species, would forage more selectively than either elk or cattle. We determined diet composition from microhistological analysis and used principal components analysis to assess dietary niches. In addition to those conventional methods, we also assessed whether dietary overlap among those three ruminants would be reflected in stable isotope ratios ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N) from fecal pellets. Principal component 1 represented a foraging axis based on plant classes, whereas principal component 2 represented a continuum from grazing to browsing, which revealed complete separation among those three large herbivores. Similarly, {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N differed significantly among species and indicated differences in moisture regimes within habitats and types of forages used by those three ruminants. Mule deer had the greatest variability in diet and foraged on more xeric forages than did either elk or cattle. Stable isotopes elucidated differences in dietary niche among the three ruminants that were not evident from dietary analysis alone.},

We hypothesized that niche overlap would be greatest between introduced cattle with either of the 2 native herbivores because coevolution between native elk and mule deer should have resulted in strong patterns of resource partitioning. We observed strong differences among species in use of space, especially elevation, steepness of slope, and use of logged forests. We used 2 temporal windows to examine both immediate (6 h) and long-term (7 days) effects of competition. We noted strong avoidance over a 6-h period among the 3 ungulates. That effect was weaker for the previous 7 days. Cattle were generalists with respect to habitat selection; the 2 native herbivores avoided areas used by cattle. Mule deer and elk avoided one another during the short temporal window (6 h), although spatial differences in habitat use often were not maintained over 7 days. Elk used lower elevations when cattle were absent and moved to higher elevations when cattle were present, indicating shifts in niche breadth and competitive displacement of elk by cattle. We demonstrated strong partitioning of resources among these 3 species, and presented evidence that competition likely has resulted in spatial displacement.},

This underscores the necessity of a long-term perspective for forest conservation and management.},

However, studies involving camera traps result in millions of images that need to be analysed, typically by visually observing each image, in order to extract data that can be used in ecological analyses. We trained machine learning models using convolutional neural networks with the ResNet-18 architecture and 3,367,383 images to automatically classify wildlife species from camera trap images obtained from five states across the United States. We tested our model on an independent subset of images not seen during training from the United States and on an out-of-sample (or ``out-of-distribution'' in the machine learning literature) dataset of ungulate images from Canada. We also tested the ability of our model to distinguish empty images from those with animals in another out-of-sample dataset from Tanzania, containing a faunal community that was novel to the model. The trained model classified approximately 2,000 images per minute on a laptop computer with 16 gigabytes of RAM. The trained model achieved 98\% accuracy at identifying species in the United States, the highest accuracy of such a model to date. Out-of-sample validation from Canada achieved 82\% accuracy and correctly identified 94\% of images containing an animal in the dataset from Tanzania.

``The Phenopix R package is one example of a package with advanced features for image-based vegetation phenology [29]. It is designed to compute vegetation indices from digital images. The computations can be done either based on ROI averages or pixel values. For ROI-averaged analyses, the user is able to define ROIs using the GUI dedicated to that option. The package implements several data filtering and post processing methods. These include different curve fitting methods, different data filtering methods, extraction of phenophases and uncertainty analysis. The package also offers functions to visualize and save results'' (Tanis et al., 2018, p. 2)

``RF = R/(R + G + B) (1) GF = G/(R + G + B) (2) BF = B/(R + G + B) (3) BR = R + G + B (4) L = 0.2989 R + 0.5870 G + 0.1140 B (5)'' (Tanis et al., 2018, p. 9)
\par
``Changes in vegetation during seasons can be monitored using GF and RF, by detecting the dates that these changes occur [11,13]. The dates can be detected in post-processing by fitting GF and RF data which is produced by FMIPROT to sigmoid curves and finding the time of the fastest change by using second order derivatives of the fitted curves. It is planned to implement the extraction of phenophases by developing a plugin to use curve fitting methods from the Phenopix R package.'' (Tanis et al., 2018, p. 9)
\par
``Green-Red Vegetation Index (GRVI) The GRVI uses the difference between green and red colors. Because of the negative red term, GRVI can get negative or positive values depending on the season and target. During the growing season GRVI should result in positive values and during the dormant season it should result in negative values for deciduous species. The GRVI of an image is calculated as, GRVI = (G - R)/(G + R) (6) where R and G are digital number values for red and green channels [6\textendash 8]. \\
In terms of calculation of the index, GRVI is similar to the widely used NDVI, where near-infrared reflectance is used instead of green reflectance. The differences between these two indices are discussed by Motohka et al., where the applicability of GRVI for vegetation phenology is studied. One benefit of using GRVI is that it is better suited to detecting a subtle disturbance in the middle of the growing period [8]. Another advantage is that GRVI results in different patterns for seasonal change for deciduous forests and grassland.'' (Tanis et al., 2018, p. 9)
\par
``Green Excess Index (2G-rbi) The green excess index uses the difference between both green-red and green-blue. The GEI of an image is calculated as, GEI = 2G - (R + B)'' (Tanis et al., 2018, p. 9)

  abstract = {A system for multiple camera networks is proposed for continuous monitoring of ecosystems by processing image time series. The system is built around the Finnish Meteorological Image PROcessing Toolbox (FMIPROT), which includes data acquisition, processing and visualization from multiple camera networks. The toolbox has a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for which only minimal computer knowledge and skills are required to use it. Images from camera networks are acquired and handled automatically according to the common communication protocols, e.g., File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Processing features include GUI based selection of the region of interest (ROI), automatic analysis chain, extraction of ROI based indices such as the green fraction index (GF), red fraction index (RF), blue fraction index (BF), green-red vegetation index (GRVI), and green excess (GEI) index, as well as a custom index defined by a user-provided mathematical formula. Analysis results are visualized on interactive plots both on the GUI and hypertext markup language (HTML) reports. The users can implement their own developed algorithms to extract information from digital image series for any purpose. The toolbox can also be run in non-GUI mode, which allows running series of analyses in servers unattended and scheduled. The system is demonstrated using an environmental camera network in Finland.},

  abstract = {Maintaining or enhancing the productive capacity and resilience of rangeland ecosystems is critical for the continued support of people who depend on them for their livelihoods, especially in the face of climatic change. This is also necessary for the continued delivery of ecosystem services derived from rangelands for the broader benefit of societies around the world. Multi-paddock grazing management has been recommended since the mid-20th century as an important tool to adaptively manage rangelands ecosystems to sustain productivity and improve animal management. Moreover, there is much anecdotal evidence from producers that, if applied appropriately, multi-paddock grazing can improve forage and livestock production. By contrast, recent reviews of published rangeland-based grazing systems studies have concluded that, in general, field trials show no superiority of vegetation or animal production in multi-paddock grazing relative to continuous yearlong stocking of single-paddock livestock production systems. Our goal is to provide a framework for rangeland management decisions that support the productivity and resiliency of rangelands and then to identify why different perceptions exist among rangeland managers who have effectively used multi-paddock grazing systems and research scientists who have studied them. First, we discuss the ecology of grazed ecosystems under free-ranging herbivores and under single-paddock fenced conditions. Second, we identify five principles underpinning the adaptive management actions used by successful grazing managers and the ecological, physiological, and behavioral framework they use to achieve desired conservation, production, and financial goals. Third, we examine adaptive management principles needed to successfully manage rangelands subjected to varying environmental conditions. Fourth, we describe the differences between the interpretation of results of grazing systems research reported in the scientific literature and the results reported by successful grazing managers; we highlight the shortcomings of most of the previously conducted grazing systems research for providing information relevant for rangeland managers who aim to achieve desired environmental and economic goals. Finally, we outline knowledge gaps and present testable hypotheses to broaden our understanding of how planned multi-paddock grazing management can be used at the ranching enterprise scale to facilitate the adaptive management of rangelands under dynamic environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {\textbullet We used photography-based grid point intercept (GPI) analysis and Daubenmire to assess ecosystem services in high-shrub rangelands.\textbullet Cover estimates were higher for some functional groups when using Daubenmire, likely because Daubenmire frames were situated below the shrub canopy and thus included subcanopy cover, whereas GPI photographs taken above the canopy could not eliminate shrubs that obscured subcanopy attributes.\textbullet Choice of methods affected assessment of two ecosystem services: sage-grouse habitat quality and site biodiversity; each was higher when using Daubenmire.\textbullet Understanding cover-estimate differences that stem from using GPI photo plots versus Daubenmire will allow practitioners to decide if GPI methods address project objectives. Accurate and timely spatial predictions of vegetation cover from remote imagery are an important data source for natural resource management. High-quality in situ data are needed to develop and validate these products. Point-intercept sampling techniques are a common method for obtaining quantitative information on vegetation cover that have been widely implemented in a number of local and national monitoring programs. The use of point-intercept data in remote sensing projects, however, is complicated due to differences in how vegetation cover indicators can be calculated. Decisions on whether to use plant intercepts from any canopy layer (i.e., any-hit cover) or only the first plant intercept at each point (i.e., top-hit cover) can result in discrepancies in cover estimates which are used to train remotely-sensed imagery. Our objective in this paper was to explore the theory of point-intercept sampling relative to training and testing remotely-sensed imagery, and to test the strength of relationships between top-hit and any-hit methods of calculating vegetation cover and high-resolution satellite imagery in two study areas managed by the Bureau of Land Management in northwestern Colorado and northeastern California. We modeled top-hit and any-hit percent cover for six vegetation indicators from 5m-resolution RapidEye imagery using beta regression. Model performance was judged using normalized root mean-squared error (RMSE) from a 5-fold cross validation. Any-hit cover estimates were significantly higher ({$\alpha$} {$<$} 0.05) than top-hit cover estimates for forbs and grasses in the White River study area, but only marginally higher in Northern California. Pseudo-R2 values for beta regression models of vegetation cover from RapidEye image information varied from 0.1525 to 0.7732 in White River and 0.2455 to 0.6085 in Northern California, with little pattern to whether any-hit or top-hit indicators produced better model fit. However, normalized RMSE was lower for any-hit cover (indicating better model performance) or minimally higher than top-hit cover for all indicators in each study area. Our results do not support the idea that top-hit cover estimates from point-intercept sampling are the most appropriate for remote sensing applications in arid and semi-arid shrub-steppe environments. In fact, having two sets of different indicators calculated from the same data may cause additional confusion in a situation where there is already considerable debate on how vegetation cover should be measured and used. Ultimately, selection of indicators to use for developing remote sensing classification or predictive models should be based first on the meaning or interpretation of the indicator in the ecosystem of interest, and second on how well the indicator performs in modeling applications. \textbullet Method comparison studies are necessary to reconcile monitoring methods that have arisen among disparate programs; however, we find that Thacker et al.'s study comparing Daubenmire frame (DF) and line-point intercept (LPI) methods for estimating vegetation cover is not adequate to support their conclusions.\textbullet Because the DF and LPI methods estimate different aspects of vegetation cover (total canopy vs. foliar cover), there should be no a priori expectation that the two techniques would produce the same results.\textbullet Thacker et al. omit critical information about their methods (sampling design, training and calibration, indicator calculations) that could have a large impact on their results and how they can be interpreted.\textbullet Differences in results between different vegetation cover measurement techniques can also be attributable to factors like observer training and calibration, plot heterogeneity and complexity, spatial distribution of vegetation, plant morphology, and plot size; thus it is difficult to draw strong conclusions from a single study.\textbullet Rather than implementing both DF and LPI techniques in sage-grouse studies as Thacker et al. recommend, effort should instead be invested in ensuring that sampling for one selected method is adequate.\textbullet Critical evaluations of vegetation measurement methods to advance the science of rangeland monitoring should be conducted and reported in a rigorous manner, provide a thorough review of previous studies, and discuss how new results contribute to existing knowledge. \textbullet Thacker et al. compared two common techniques for assessing greater sage-grouse habitat: Daubenmire quadrats and line-point intercept sampling.\textbullet Sampling only 16 Daubenmire quadrats may not have been adequate to support Thacker et al.'s assertion that line-point sampling yields higher cover values and that the two methods are not comparable.\textbullet Using data from sagebrush ecosystems in Montana, we show that mean percent cover changes depending on the number of Daubenmire quadrats sampled and that 16 Daubenmire quadrats may not be sufficient to accurately characterize sagebrush vegetation.\textbullet Assessing the appropriate sampling effort for the method and study is a crucial part of designing sampling protocols and has implications for greater sage-grouse management and conservation.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary: Monitoring changes in the utilization of forages across rangelands can be time consuming and difficult with untrained personnel. The use of real time positioning for cattle is becoming commercially available with the improvements in technology. The objective of this case study was to identify the changes in livestock social associations and spatial location at two stocking densities throughout a six-week grazing period. Both pastures used similar sized herds with 35 and 29 animals tracked with global positioning systems set at 30-min intervals. A half-weight index value was calculated for each pair of tracked cattle to determine the proportion of time that cattle were within 75 m and 500 m of each other. Throughout the study, forage utilization increased from 5 to 24\% and from 10\% to 20\% and forage mass decreased from 2601 kg ha-1 to 1828 kg ha-1 and 2343 kg ha-1 to 1904 kg ha-1, in the high stocking density pasture and low stocking density pasture, respectively. Utilization of forages throughout the trial forced cattle to disperse and travel further from water sources to find new feeds. Real-time GPS tracking has the potential to remotely detect changes in animal spatial association, identify when cows disperse, and improve recognition for the need of pasture rotation to avoid rangeland degradation. Proper grazing management of arid and semi-arid rangelands requires experienced personnel and monitoring. Applications of GPS tracking and sensor technologies could help ranchers identify livestock well-being and grazing management issues so that they can promptly respond. The objective of this case study was to evaluate temporal changes in cattle association patterns using global positioning system (GPS) tracking in pastures with different stocking densities (low stocking density [LSD] = 0.123 animals ha-1, high stocking density [HSD] = 0.417 animals ha-1) at a ranch near Prescott, Arizona. Both pastures contained similar herd sizes (135 and 130 cows, respectively). A total of 32 cows in the HSD herd and 29 cows in the LSD herd were tracked using GPS collars at location fixes of 30 min during a 6-week trial in the summer of 2019. A half-weight index (HWI) value was calculated for each pair of GPS-tracked cattle (i.e., dyads) to determine the proportion of time that cattle were within 75 m and 500 m of each other. Forage mass of both pastures were relatively similar at the beginning of the study and forage utilization increased from 5 to 24\% in the HSD pasture and increased from 10 to 20\% in the LSD pasture. Cattle in both pastures exhibited relatively low mean association values (HWI {$<$} 0.25) at both spatial scales. Near the end of the study, cattle began to disperse likely in search of forages (p {$<$} 0.01) and travelled farther (p {$<$} 0.01) from water than during earlier periods. Real-time GPS tracking has the potential to remotely detect changes in animal spatial association (e.g., HWI), and identify when cows disperse, likely searching for forage.},

  abstract = {Foraging niche overlap among Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), Rocky Mountain mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus), and cattle (Bos taurus) was studied for 2 years on 37 000 ha of nonforested foothill and mountain habitat in northwestern Wyoming. Microhistological analysis was used to quantify botanical composition of ungulate diets from monthly fecal collections. Feeding habitat use was determined through monthly surveys from fixed-wing aircraft to record nonsolitary animals in nonforested habitat. Kulcyznski's similarity index was used to calculate dietary and feeding habitat overlap among the 3 ungulates, and these 2 indices were multiplied together to estimate foraging niche overlap. In all seasons, elk and cattle consumed grass-dominated diets (mean = 61\% and 81\%, respectively), although elk diets were more diverse. Mule deer consumed more forbs and shrubs than either elk or cattle (P {$<$} 0.10). Foraging niche overlap was high (45\%) between mule deer and elk in spring. Cattle in summer and fall had {$\geq$}60\% foraging niche overlap with elk in spring, indicating that, in spring, elk foraged in many of the same places (largely sagebrush grassland) and ate diets similar in botanical composition to what cattle did during summer and fall (principally Festuca idahoensis, Pseudoroegneria spicata, and Achnatherum spp.). Foraging niche overlap also was high (41\%\textendash 51\%) between elk in winter and cattle in summer and fall. Therefore, if competitive or complementary relationships existed between elk and cattle, these interactions most likely occurred on sagebrush grasslands where cattle use in summer\textendash fall was followed by elk use in winter\textendash spring. We recommend that resource managers focus their forage utilization and range trend monitoring in foothill sagebrush grasslands. Resumen Se estudi\'o el traslape del nicho de forrajeo entre el alce de las Monta\~nas Rocallosas, (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), el venado mula de las Monta\~nas Rocallosas (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus) y el ganado (Bos taurus); el estudio se condujo por dos a\~nos en 37 000 ha de h\'abitats deforestado al pie de monta\~na y monta\~noso situados en el noroeste de Wyoming. La composici\'on bot\'anica de la dieta de los ungulados se determin\'o a partir de muestras fecales colectadas mensualmente y con el uso del an\'alisis microhistol\'ogico. El uso de h\'abitat alimenticio se determin\'o a trav\'es de muestreos mensuales por medio de un dispositivo a\'ereo de alas fijas para registrar los animales no solitarios en el h\'abitat deforestado. El \'indice de similaridad de Kulcyznski se uso para calcular el traslape de la dieta y del h\'abitat alimenticio entre los tres ungulados, y estos dos \'indices se multiplicaron para estimar el traslape del nicho de forrajeo. En todas las \'epocas de a\~no, el alce y el ganado consumieron dietas dominadas por zacates (media = 61\% y 81\%, respectivamente), aunque las dietas del alce fueron m\'as diversas. El venado mula consumi\'o m\'as hierbas y arbustos que el alce y el ganado (P {$<$} 0.10). En primavera, el traslape del nicho de forrajeo fue alto (45\%) entre el venado mula y el alce. En verano y oto\~no, el ganado tuvo un traslape del nicho de forrajeo {$\geq$}60\% con el alce, indicando que en primavera, el alce forraje\'o en muchos de los mismos lugares (principalmente pastizal de ``Sagebrush'') y comi\'o dietas similares en composici\'on bot\'anica a las del ganado en verano y oto\~no (principalmente (principalmente Festuca idahoensis, Achnatherum spp. y Pseudoroegneria spicata). El traslape del nicho de forrajeo tambi\'en fue alto (41\%\textendash 51\%) entre el alce en invierno y el ganado en verano y oto\~no. Por lo tanto, si existieron relaciones competitivas o complementarias entre el alce y el ganado, estas interacciones ocurrieron m\'as probablemente en los pastizales de ``Sagebrush,'' donde el uso por el ganado en verano\textendash oto\~no es seguido por el uso del alce en invierno\textendash primavera. Recomendamos que los manejadores de los recursos enfoquen sus monitoreos de utilizaci\'on de forraje y tendencia del pastizal en los pastizales de ``Sagebrush.''.},

  abstract = {A virtual fence can be defined as a structure serving as an enclosure, a barrier, or a boundary without a physical barrier. The concept of virtual fencing occurs increasingly in discussions wherever free-ranging livestock is managed. It is especially interesting because of its potential to initially enhance ecological management, improve management by turning manual labour into cognitive labour as well as improve the life-style of livestock managers. All of these have the potential to reduce costs. Moreover, it opens up the possibility of managing areas that are not manageable at the moment. Therefore, a patent and literature search was conducted to investigate what virtual fencing involves, what opportunities there are for implementing it and what issues still need to be tackled. It was found that there are many different approaches in the development of virtual fencing, which can be split into three categories: first, to contain animals in a defined area or keep them out of a defined area using devices that are animal-borne; second, to contain animals without mounting a device onto the animal; and third, keeping animals apart with a moving fence line or using a virtual fence as a remote gathering device. The first two categories deal with static control of livestock, whereas the third category could be described as a control within moving boundaries. However, despite many patents having been found, only very few products are available on the market.},

``Moreover, there is a perception, especially in Europe, that the main aversive stimulus, an electric stimulus, is problematic in terms of animal welfare and this will also be addressed and discussed.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 11)
\par
``Virtual fencing offers the potential for improving the efficiency in which grazing management is carried out. One major advan- tage is the flexibility in managing stocking density it can provide. \\
The efficient use, in terms of optimised grazing management, of available land is difficult to achieve, often due to terrain, size of conventional paddocks and lack of labour.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 11)
\par
``Currently, conventional or electric fences are the main tool to control livestock foraging in developed countries. Unfortunately, `conventional fences' are fixed in space and cannot be readily adapted to changing circum- stances. This inability to be changed rapidly can have a direct impact on management, such as dealing with seasonal changes in vegetation, or periods when animals should be excluded from watercourses or catchments.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 11)

``to optimise grazing distribution has gone on for many decades \\
and is still ongoing (e.g. Launchbaugh and Howery, 2005; Bailey \\

1966; Jardine and Anderson, 1919)'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 11)
\par
``In particular, the protection of riparian areas is mentioned often (e.g. Bailey, 2004; DelCurto et al., 1999; Rose, 1991). On extensive rangeland farms, foraging areas or water courses can be too large or too difficult to fence, because of the terrain or lack of access, and therefore fencing costs may be disproportionately high due to the low stocking rate.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 11)
\par
``However, electric fencing systems also provide flexibility. On the other hand, they are also very time-consuming and labour- intensive to erect and maintain and often impractical to check frequently.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 11)
\par
``in more difficult terrain and remote places these electric fence sys- tems might not work, whereas virtual fence might even be able to manage grazing livestock in real-time in these areas'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 11)

``Cost reduction is often mentioned in conjunction with virtual fencing. Fencing costs are a serious problem for extensive farms.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 11)
\par
``It needs to be taken into consideration that it is not only the erection of fencing, but also the maintenance which results in very high costs'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 11)
\par
``An important question is whether virtual fencing could be cost effective to control livestock compared to conventional fencing.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 11)
\par
``However, we have to consider that virtual fences cannot be used in all areas of bound- ary fencing. For example, fields near main roads need always to be fenced with a conventional fence. Whenever leaky boundaries are not acceptable, virtual fencing is not an option. On the other hand, virtual fences do provide much greater management opportunities where animal distribution is key to the management.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 12)

``Harrington and Conover (2006), for example, have studied wild ungulate behaviour and mortality associated with wire fences and found a considerable amount of mortalities are attributable to these fences. In their study area, they estimated an annual mortality rate of 0.25 mortalities/km road fence.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 12)

``Enclosing the pastures was a long process, \\
because the cheapest option to herd and therefore control ani- \\
mals was the use of child labour'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 12) Meaning it took a long time because it was economically disadvantageous to fence in a pasture because kids would herd animals for nearly free.

``Michael Kelly invented the first barbed wire, which consisted of two twisted wires, in November 1868 (US patent no. 74379). It was known as the ``thorny fence''. The second wire had the function of strengthening the fence, but it also had the side effect of forming a cable for barbs. In 1874 (November 24th, no. 157124), Joseph Glid- den designed a barbed wire, this time specifically pointing out the advantage to locking the barbs into place. He also invented, together with Vaughan, a hand-operated machine ``for facilitating the work of applying wire barbs to fence wires'', registered as a US patent on the 8th of December 1874 (No. 157508).''

\par
``a method and apparatus for controlling a domestic animal wearing a receiver circuit. A signal-emitting wire is placed to surround a predetermined area (Peck, 1973). The patent targeted mainly dogs and cats and the device administers a ``physical effect such as a noise annoying the animal or a physical shock directly to the ani- mal'' when coming near the wire. Peck's idea is still commercially available under the name ``Invisible Fence'' and was later used in livestock trials.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 13)
\par
``Brose's patent, filed in 1988, is more sophisticated and mentions distance zones from a central point (Brose, 1990). The perimeters of the different zones are measured by the received strength of a radio frequency transmission. Animals can receive either warn- ing sounds, physical stimuli, or both, depending on the location relating to the zone (Brose, 1990). No wire is necessary for Brose's system'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 13)
\par
``Aine (1992) on the con- trary, describes a wireless control system for animals and mentions specifically that the system is used to protect areas to be grazed by cattle. The system also administers audio and electric stimuli and uses omnidirection wireless radio transmitters. The animals are warned ``to remain within the lobe of the transmitter station and the lobe is readily moved to facilitate herding and rotational grazing''. \\
In another embodiment, the animal is warned not to cross a line (electronic fence) defined between a pair of overlapping lobes of the transmitter station. A third overlapping lobe of radiation provides an electronic gate in the electronic fence by disabling the animal warning device within the localized region of the third lobe. Alter- nately energizing the pair of overlapping lobes facilitates detection of the electronic fence.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 13)
\par
``One disadvantage of some virtual fencing systems is that the animals have to carry the device. If it is mounted on a collar, or even on a neck saddle, these may cause negative effects in terms of skin irritations or more importantly could get caught on a feeder, or other structure, causing the animal distress or injury.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 13)

``Another prob- lem is that the devices have to be adjusted if the animals grow, gain'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 13)

``Rose (1991) describes an Animal Implant Electrical Stimulator to be implanted in the nose or the upper lip. \\
The device is particularly suited for domestic cattle and sheep and the signal transmitters/receivers are mounted to poles. The range of transmission can be over 5 miles'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 14)
\par
``Quigley (1995) also describes a virtual fencing system for live- stock such as cows, sheep, pigs, goats and horses. Quigley invented a system, which is not, as usually described, mounted on the ani- mal with a collar; he chose a system which is incorporated in an ear tag. The system also works with audio warnings and electric stim- uli, but has a safety device included, preventing the animal from receiving too many stimuli.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 14)

``in 1999, a patent was granted to Marsh for a fenceless animal control system using locational information acquired by the Global Positioning System (GPS). He describes in his invention that the system permits virtually labour-free redefini- tion of the confinement boundaries. Because it uses GPS, the system does not need any specific infrastructure apart from the devices mounted onto the animals.Marsh's system also uses audible signals and electric shock.''

``In a demonstration trial conducted near Union, Oregon, USA and equipment designed by the United States Department of Agriculture-Forest Service (USDA-FS), neck-collared animals stayed within the virtual boundary and withdrew from the fence when an electric shock was applied (Quigley et al., 1990).'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 14)
\par
``In 2001, Anderson and Hale patented a virtual fence system also based on GPS technology. The device has been tested in the form of a neck saddle, however, a patent is currently being issued for a head/ear device termed an Ear-A-Round (EarTM) (Anderson, 2010).'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 14)
\par
``Tibbs et al. (1995) investigated the influence of electronic diver- sion from riparian areas on livestock grazing behaviour, nutritional physiology, stress physiology and performance. Thirty-six yearling heifers and eight fistulated steers were included in the experiment and distributed among six groups, three control groups with free access to the entire pasture and three groups where animals carried virtual fence ear tags, working on the basis of audio warning cues and electric stimuli. The ear tags were used to divert the animals from riparian areas. According to the authors, the animals showed no difference in stress levels or in body condition score. However, a higher weight gain was detected in the control groups. Tibbs et al. \\
explain this with a higher quality diet, because the control animals were able to access the riparian areas.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 16)
\par
``This is just one example, but it illus- trates the problem the animal may face if the GPS predicts that it is changing from inside to outside of the enclosure without moving, resulting in application of aversive stimuli. Out of the 524 fixes, 5 wrongly indicate that the GPS collars changed direction by 180{$\smwhtcircle$}.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)
\par
``This can result in imprecise and confusing signals from the vir- tual fence to the animal. Imprecise and confusing signals do not support the learning process of animals to associate warning signals with the electric shock. The correct timing between stimulus and response is key for learning success (Pryor, 1975).'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)
\par
``However, Butler et al. (2006) noted that looking for correlations between sound events and changes in the GPS data was a primary analysis method, though they found it limited by the spatial accuracy of the GPS position data'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)
\par
``In addition, Tiedemann et al. (1999) stated that animals are confused when herd mates receive their stimulus at different distances. This would be the case when using uncorrected GPS receivers for a virtual fence.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)
\par
``Tiedemann et al. (1999) also found that when ear tags on lead animals became inoperable and those animals were able to move into the exclusion zone, other animals endured the audio electrical stimulus to join them. They concluded from that result, that it is important to train the leaders of the herd. This could also indicate that it might be enough to put collars just on the lead animals.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)
\par
``This could also indicate \\
that it might be enough to put collars just on the lead animals.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18) More research needed to support this idea.

``GPS as well as other components are relatively power-hungry.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)
\par
``the energy consumption depends on the on-time of the GPS. The on-time depends on the availability of satellites and the setup of the collar'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)
\par
``From the user's point of view, the energy supply needs to be reliable and long lasting. A constant change of batteries is not an option for free ranging animals and would be far too labour intensive'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)
\par
``an option to minimise energy consumption by switching to standby mode if the animal does not move over a pre-programmable amount of time. When the movement starts again the system will be re- activated.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)

``Simeray and Laligant (1999) invented a device to harvest energy using the seebeck effect to exploit relatively low temper- ature differentials. Wong (2000) invented a device specifically to harvest body heat from animals.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)
\par
``It should be emphasised, that as long as the power issue is not resolved, the system will not be ready for practical use on farms. \\
Therefore, the provision of power needs to be regarded as one of the key issues in the development process.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)

``A virtual fence unit needs to be able to communicate with an interface in order to enable, e.g. a stockperson to change bound- aries, find out that the animal escaped or to check if the unit is still in working order.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)
\par
``An approach widely used in dairy farming is, that the cows carry an animal-borne device for data recording, which is downloaded at a fixed point such as the milking parlour, milking robot or feeding station. This is not a suitable option for animals in most extensive systems.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)
\par
``For example, water troughs or salt licks could be used as points to house a data download- ing device, but in countries with higher rain fall animals might be'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 18)
\par
``able to drink from puddles or other sources and may not come near \\
the download points for a long time.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19) But it would work for western cattle as they come into water at least once a day. What if we also paired a RFID reader at each water station to the collar that way we would know the time each cow came in to drink and get an inventory of the herd each day.
\par
``Bremner (2008) invented a system based on electric fencing as a power supply to pass on mes- sages from mobile nodes to a central station'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Nadimi et al. (2008) monitored pasture time in a specific area using wireless sensor net- works. The cows were equipped with wireless nodes around the neck'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Butler et al. (2004) mentioned that the collars are ``tasked with the virtual fence coordinates and virtual fence motion plan using multi-hop ad-hoc networking because the pastures are too large for single-hop messages to reach all the animals''.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Anderson and Hale (2001, p. 14) also included in their patent the possibility to integrate radio frequency (RF) transponders. The RF transpon- ders should enable the units to communicate with other devices worn by animals, or to communicate with a central microprocessor.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``This capability allows automated management, including herding \\
over space and time, selective breeding among multi-sire herds and \\
manipulation of spatial density among foraging groups.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19) Desired management outcomes but not much evidence to support the.
\par
``The development of virtual fencing can be seen as the base for Precision Livestock Farming in extensive systems and Precision Rangeland Management.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``other sensors could be added to these systems to provide the stockmen with important additional information. This information could be used to provide an early warning system for health problems or welfare problems, e.g. mal- nutrition (e.g. Umst\"atter et al., 2008; Butler et al., 2006). Butler et al. \\
(2006) also mentioned that virtual fences allow fine motion control and monitoring of animals.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``An automatic guidance system could be developed to optimise the use of large rangeland areas. Rango et al. (2003) men- tions a remote sensing component to complete the overall virtual fence system. The remote sensing component is used to monitor the amount and spatial location of forage on the range and also to determine the routes to move livestock from one grazing loca- tion to the newly identified one'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Eastwood et al. (2009)'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Anderson (2007) reported that the term virtual fence is not yet universally agreed upon'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Yet all literature that deals with virtual fenc- ing assumes animals are controlled without physical barriers on the landscape'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Many advantages of virtual fencing can be found in the literature, especially in the area of improving the grazing'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``management of rangelands (such as distribution of livestock and being able to graze areas which could not be fenced otherwise), in terms of fence cost and labour cost reductions.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Due to the possibil- ity of gathering livestock at different speed and even very slowly, the possibility exists for an animal welfare gain to be seen here.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``With virtual fencing, the system \\
can be switched off very quickly and animals can make their own \\
decisions to survive'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19) Escaping a natural disaster such as wildfire
\par
``When the emergency is over the animals can \\
easily be tracked and caught with the help of the GPS technology \\
incorporated in the virtual fence devices.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Because the animals have to carry a device, there is some impact on the animal and, especially in the case of collars, this needs to be checked on a regular basis to re-adjust for size and to avoid or detect skin irritation. Moreover, the collars need to fit tightly to avoid animals getting caught by the collar in trees, feeders or other structures'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``It cannot be emphasised enough that the power issue is a major obstacle to overcome.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Another problem of virtual fencing is the issue of applying elec- tric stimuli to the animal. This causes concern about animal welfare.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``The major difference is that the warning cue in an electric fence is visual (seeing the fence) whereas in a virtual fencing system the warn- ing cue is often audible. If the animal has a chance to learn the link between an audio cue and the electric stimulus, then a virtual fence cannot be seen as an animal welfare problem'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Virtual fences even have the advantage that the location of the shock applica- tion is defined and therefore a stimulus of minimal strength can be applied.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``This is an advantage compared to electric fences needing to cope with changing conditions such as varying moisture content of the soil, or contact with vegetation'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``because the flow of electricity through the body at different parts results in a different resistance (Raith, 1999, pp. 893\textendash 894). Therefore, electric fencing often works with higher impulse energy (Joule) and higher voltage (up to 4000 V for more difficult animals or those with thicker hides or coats) than can be used for virtual fence devices, particularly to compensate for the loss of power due to vegetation coming in to contact with the fence'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Moreover, the found references regarding elec- tric shock (Section 5.1) did not show a significant welfare problem during test trials, especially when the electric shock does not come randomly and therefore unexpected (Schalke et al., 2007). How- ever, it is very important to create a fail-safe device which cannot be (accidentally) used for abuse'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 19)
\par
``Apart from audio and electrical stimulation, the options of odours, edible treats and light have been considered in previous studies or patents. Odours and edible treats need to be replenished and are, therefore, less suitable for livestock in extensive systems. \\
Light is also difficult as a sole approach, because it is not visible in bright daylight, but it could be a useful addition at night.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 20)
\par
``Amended barbed wire is still accepted for use in major parts of the agricultural world, although the issue of livestock injuries is still widely known,5 whereas a virtual fence is often seen as compromising animal welfare. Especially among bod- ies funding research, there seems to be an objection against this new technology. Objectively comparing those two technologies, in the author's opinion, there is not enough evidence to class virtual fences as a higher welfare threat than barbed wire.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 20)
\par
``The crucial point for a system that is acceptable in terms of ani- \\
mal welfare is to develop a virtual fence system that gives animals \\
a fair chance to learn how the technology works. For learning in \\
general, the correct timing is the most important key to quick and \\
affective learning (Pryor, 1975). It is an issue that uncorrected GPS, \\
in its current state, is not accurate enough to provide support for the \\
correct timing of cues. However, with e.g. reference stations, and/or \\
adequate correction algorithms it should be possible to overcome \\
the problems of GPS accuracy and precision.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 20) Could you use the gateways as GPS reference stations to improve GPS accuracy?
\par
``The following unresolved issues need to be addressed: \textbullet{} Energy supply. \\
\textbullet{} Investigation of learning behaviour and training possibilities for virtually fenced animals, especially when based on GPS, and con- sequently investigation of their welfare state. \\
\textbullet{} Learning behaviour and welfare investigation for remotely gath- ered livestock using aversive stimuli, such as electric stimuli. \\
\textbullet{} Miniaturisation of device. \\
\textbullet{} Are there any reliable options of using positive reinforcement? \textbullet{} Investigation of other aversive or inert stimuli to replace electric stimuli. \\
\textbullet{} More research needs to be done to make the devices fail safe (such as the locking mechanism in Quigley's patent).'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 20)
\par
``Vermont (2002) reports a much lower number of over about 95\% of patents that are unli- censed, at any given time. The author also states that even over about 97\% of patents are generating no royalties. Another study of patents and patent licensing at six leading U.S. universities showed that the top 10\% of patents generate 92\% of all royalty payments (Federman, s.a.).'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 20)
\par
``However, Vermont (2002) also brings up another interesting issue; many patents are never licensed, because the companies that own them secure more value bymonopolizing the technology than by licensing it out'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 20)
\par
``Napolitano and Sirilli (1990) also found that of the exploited inventions, two- thirds were used within 2 years after filing. Coming up with a new patentable idea and developing a technology to a marketable stage are two different things. The latter requires often a high amount of money and an infrastructure to market a product'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 20)
\par
``The first approach is to contain animals in a defined area, or keep animals out of a defined area, using devices which are animal-borne. That approach can be split into two subgroups. Subgroup 1 uses an infrastructure, such as poles or cables with transmitters. Subgroup 2 uses GPS as a tracking facility'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 20)
\par
``The next category contains the development of a virtual fence where no device is mounted onto the animal. The cues are delivered from devices near the virtual fence line, e.g. mounted onto poles'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 20)
\par
``The last category deals with moving fence lines. Either the virtual fence system is used as a gathering device or as a means of keeping animals apart from each other. That means that the fence line moves with the moving animals.'' (Umstatter, 2011, p. 20)},

  abstract = {Global positioning systems (GPSs) enable continuous and automatic tracking of an animal's position. The value of such spatial\textendash temporal information can be improved if the corresponding activity of the animal is known. We evaluated the potential of Lotek GPS collars to predict activity of beef cattle on extensive rangeland in 2 contrasting foraging environments. Collars were configured to record animal location at intervals of 20 minutes (United States) or 5 minutes (Israel), together with counts from 2 motion sensors. Synchronized field observations of collared cows were conducted in 1999 (United States) and in 2002 and 2003 (Israel). Grazing, traveling (without grazing), and resting activities were recorded as minutes out of 20 for each category (United States), or as a single category (Israel). For the US data, stepwise regression models of grazing, traveling, and resting time accounted for 74\%\textendash 84\% of the variation, on the basis of the motion sensor counts for the left\textendash right axis and the distances between GPS fixes. Regression tree analysis of grazing time yielded a simple model (4 splits) that accounted for 85\% of the variation. For the Israeli data, the misclassification rates obtained by discriminant analysis and classification tree analysis of animal activity were 14\% and 12\%, respectively. In both analyses, almost all grazing observations were correctly classified, but other activities were sometimes misclassified as grazing. Distance alone is a poor indicator of animal activity, but grazing, traveling, and resting activities of free-ranging cattle can be inferred with reasonable accuracy from data provided by Lotek GPS collars. Resumen Los sistemas de posicionamiento global (GPS) permiten el rastreo continuo y autom\'atico de la posici\'on de un animal. El valor de tal informaci\'on espacial-temporal pueden ser mejorado si la actividad correspondiente del animal es conocida. Evaluamos el potencial de los collares de GPS Lotek para predecir la actividad del ganado para carne en un pastizal extensivo en dos ambientes de forrajeo contrastantes. Los collares fueron configurados para registrar la ubicaci\'on del animal a intervalos de 20min (US) o 5min (Israel), junto con conteos de dos sensores de movimiento. En 1999 (US), 2001 y 2002 (Israel) se condujeron observaciones de campo sincronizadas de las vacas con collar. Se registraron actividades de apacentamiento, viaje (sin apacentamiento) y descanso en t\'erminos de minutos dedicados a cada actividad dentro del per\'iodo de 20 minutos (US) o como una sola categor\'ia (Israel). Para los datos de US, los modelos de regresi\'on a pasos para apacentamiento, viaje y tiempo de descanso explicaron de 74-84\% de la variaci\'on, basados en los conteos del sensor de movimiento para los ejes derecho-izquierdo y las distancias entre las determinaciones del GPS. El an\'alisis de regresi\'on de \'arbol del tiempo de apacentamiento produjo un modelo simple (cuatro divisiones) que explicaron el 85\% de la variaci\'on. Para los datos de Israel, las tasas de clasificaci\'on err\'onea obtenidas por el an\'alisis discriminante y el an\'alisis de clasificaci\'on de \'arbol fueron 14\% y 12\% respectivamente. En ambos an\'alisis, casi todas las observaciones de apacentamiento fueron clasificadas correctamente, pero las otras actividades algunas veces fueron clasificadas err\'oneamente como apacentamiento. La distancia sola es un indicador pobre de la actividad animal, pero las actividades de apacentamiento, viaje y descanso del ganado en libre apacentamiento pueden ser inferidas con una certeza razonable a partir de datos provenientes de collares de GPS Lotek.},

Additionally, there is little information about whether, and in which contexts, livestock might functionally replace native herbivore wildlife or, alternatively, have fundamentally different effects on plant species composition. The Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment, which has been running since 1995, is composed of six treatment combinations of mega-herbivores, meso-herbivore ungulate wildlife, and cattle. We sampled herbaceous vegetation 25 times between 1999 and 2013. We used partial redundancy analysis and linear mixed models to assess effects of herbivore treatments on overall plant community composition and key plant species. Plant communities in the six different herbivore treatments shifted directionally over time and diverged from each other substantially by 2013. Plant community composition was strongly related (R2 = 0.92) to residual plant biomass, a measure of herbivore utilization. Addition of any single herbivore type (cattle, wildlife, or mega-herbivores) caused a shift in plant community composition that was proportional to its removal of plant biomass. These results suggest that overall herbivory pressure, rather than herbivore type or complex interactions among different herbivore types, was the main driver of changes in plant community composition. Individual plant species, however, did respond most strongly to either wild ungulates or cattle. Although these results suggest considerable functional similarity between a suite of native wild herbivores (which included grazers, browsers, and mixed feeders) and cattle (mostly grazers) with respect to understory plant community composition, responses of individual plant species demonstrate that at the plant-population-level impacts of a single livestock species are not functionally identical to those of a diverse group of native herbivores.},

  abstract = {1. Through their effects on plant communities, herbivores can exert strong direct and indirect effects on savanna ecosystems and have the potential to create and maintain savanna landscape heterogeneity. Throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, periodic creation and abandonment of livestock corrals leads to landscape mosaics of long-term ecosystem hotspots that attract both cattle and large ungulate wildlife. 2. The development and maintenance of vegetation in these types of hotspots may be controlled in part by herbivory. Cattle and wildlife may have different, potentially contrasting effects on plant succession and plant\textendash plant interactions. We ask how cattle and wild herbivores affect the maintenance and vegetation development of corral-derived landscape heterogeneity (0.25\textendash 1.0 ha treeless `glades') in Laikipia, Kenya, through their effects on long-term successional and short-term plant\textendash plant dynamics. 3. We used the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment to exclude from glades different combinations of cattle, large ungulate wildlife (i.e. zebras, gazelles and other antelopes), and mega-herbivore wildlife (i.e. giraffes and elephants). We first assessed long-term changes in cover of the dominant grass species, Cynodon plectostachyus and Pennisetum stramineum (the early- and late-dominant species, respectively). We then used a neighbour removal experiment to test the effects of different herbivores on competition and facilitation between the two glade grass species. 4. In the long-term experiment, we found that large ungulate wildlife reinforced landscape heterogeneity over time by helping maintain glades in their early C. plectostachyus-dominated form. Cattle and mega-herbivore wildlife, on the other hand, appeared to reduce the positive effects through forage preference for C. plectostachyus. 5. In the neighbour removal experiment, we found that each grass species benefited from facilitation when it was the preferred forage for the dominant grazer. Facilitation of C. plectostachyus by P. stramineum was strongest when cattle co-occurred with wildlife, whereas facilitation of P. stramineum by C. plectostachyus was strongest when cattle were absent. 6. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that different combinations of cattle and wildlife have different effects, largely via contrasting forage preferences, on the persistence of landscape heterogeneity in this savanna landscape. More generally, we provide evidence for contrasting effects of cattle and wildlife on short-term plant interactions (facilitation) and successional processes within the herbaceous plant community.},

  abstract = {Free-roaming horses (Equus ferus caballus) occur throughout arid and semiarid regions of the western United States, where they can decrease plant biomass and diversity, impair water quality, and reduce forage available to native wildlife and domestic livestock. Management of free-roaming horses on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and US Forest Service lands is determined by protections and population targets established by law, but these do not apply to other federal or Tribal Lands, where relatively little is known about the abundance and distribution of free-roaming horses. To address this information gap, we conducted the first comprehensive survey of free-roaming horses within the Navajo Nation, which is the largest Tribal Land holding in the contiguous United States and covers portions of the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. We used stratified random sampling and double-observer distance methods to produce estimates of horse abundance corrected for detection bias. During the summer of 2016, we used fixed-wing aircraft to survey 4 975 km of transects across our 67 089-km2 study area. We observed 4 290 horses distributed among 527 groups and estimated 38 223 horses lived within the study area during the survey period (standard of error [SE]: 6 052, 90\% confidence interval: 29 365\textendash 47 080), with 29 394 horses in open areas (SE: 5 511, 90\% confidence interval [CI]: 21 328\textendash 37 460) and 8 829 horses in forested areas (SE: 2 331, 90\% CI: 5 417\textendash 12 240). Overall density of 0.570 horses/km2 (SE: 0.090, 90\% CI: 0.438\textendash 0.702) was 23\% higher than density of horses and burros (Equus asinus) in all BLM herd management areas (HMAs) in 2016 and exceeded by 17\% the density in Nevada, the only state with an HMA of comparable size to the Navajo Nation. Our results will inform management of a free-roaming horse population that this study has revealed to be the among the largest in the United States.},

Our findings suggest that modifying landscape?level human?use patterns may be more effective at managing this ecosystem than intentional removal of wolves.},

  abstract = {Large herbivore migrations are imperiled globally; however the factors limiting a population across its migratory range are typically poorly understood. Zambia's Greater Liuwa Ecosystem (GLE) contains one of the largest remaining blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus taurinus) migrations, yet the population structure, vital rates, and limiting factors are virtually unknown. We conducted a long-term demographic study of GLE wildebeest from 2012 to 2019 of 107 collared adult females and their calves, 7352 herd observations, 12 aerial population surveys, and concurrent carnivore studies. We applied methods of vital rate estimation and survival analysis within a Bayesian estimation framework. From herd composition observations, we estimated rates of fecundity, first-year survival, and recruitment as 68\%, 56\%, and 38\% respectively, with pronounced interannual variation. Similar rates were estimated from calf-detections with collared cows. Adult survival rates declined steadily from 91\% at age 2 years to 61\% at age 10 years thereafter dropping more sharply to 2\% at age 16 years. Predation, particularly by spotted hyena, was the predominant cause of death for all wildebeest ages and focused on older animals. Starvation only accounted for 0.8\% of all unbiased known natural causes of death. Mortality risk differed substantially between wet and dry season ranges, reflecting strong spatio-temporal differences in habitat and predator densities. There was substantial evidence that mortality risk to adults was 27\% higher in the wet season, and strong evidence that it was 45\% higher in the migratory range where predator density was highest. The estimated vital rates were internally consistent, predicting a stable population trajectory consistent with aerial estimates. From essentially zero knowledge of GLE wildebeest dynamics, this work provides vital rates, age structure, limiting factors, and a plausible mechanism for the migratory tendency, and a robust model-based foundation to evaluate the effects of potential restrictions in migratory range, climate change, predator\textendash prey dynamics, and poaching.},

Parameters estimated are state-specific survival rates and encounter probabilities and transition probabilities between states. The multistate model provides a valuable framework to evaluate important ecological questions. For example, estimation of state-specific survival and transition probabilities between the biological states of breeders and nonbreeders allows estimation of the cost of reproduction. Transitions between physical states, such as spatial areas, provide estimates needed for meta-population models. The basic multistate model uses only live recaptures, but 3 extensions are included in MARK. A multistate model with live and dead encounters is available, although the dead encounters are not state specific. Robust-design multistate models are also included in MARK, with both open and closed robust designs. These models assume that animals move between states only between primary sessions of the robust design. For the closed robust design, we can specify 12 different data types for the modeling of encounter probabilities during the primary session, including 6 versions of the closed model likelihood incorporating population size (N) directly in the likelihood, and 6 versions of the Huggins model in which N is estimated as a derived parameter outside the likelihood. One assumption that is generally necessary to estimate state-specific survival rates in the multistate model is that transitions take place immediately before encounter occasions. Otherwise, survival rates over the interval between encounter occasions are a mix of survival rates over multiple states. Advantages of using MARK to estimate the parameters of the various multistate models include flexibility of model specification to include group, time, and individual covariates, estimation of variance components, model averaging of parameter estimates, and Bayesian parameter estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures on the logit scale.},

``Good data management is not a goal in itself, but rather is the key conduit leading to knowledge discovery and innovation, and to subsequent data and knowledge integration and reuse by the community after the data publication process.'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 1)
\par
``Beyond proper collection, annotation, and archival, data stewardship includes the notion of `long-term care' of valuable digital assets, with the goal that they should be discovered and re-used for downstream investigations, either alone, or in combination with newly generated data.'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 1)
\par
``simple guideposts to inform those who publish and/or preserve scholarly data, would be of great utility. \\
This article describes four foundational principles\textemdash Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 1)
\par
``Importantly, it is our intent that the principles apply not only to `data' in the conventional sense, but also to the algorithms, tools, and workflows that led to that data. All scholarly digital research objects2 \textemdash from data to analytical pipelines\textemdash benefit from application of these principles, since all components of the research process must be available to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and reusability.'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 1)
\par
``One of the grand challenges of data-intensive science, therefore, is to improve knowledge discovery through assisting both humans, and their computational agents, in the discovery of, access to, and integration and analysis of, task-appropriate scientific data and other scholarly digital objects.'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``For certain types of important digital objects, there are well-curated, deeply-integrated, special-purpose repositories such as Genbank3, Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB4), and UniProt5 in the life sciences; Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF; http://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and Set of Identifications, Measurements and Bibliography for Astronomical Data (SIMBAD6) in the space sciences.'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``Many important datasets emerging from traditional, low-throughput bench science don't fit in the data models of these special-purpose repositories, yet these datasets are no less important with respect to integrative research, reproducibility, and reuse in general.'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``Apparently in response to this, we see the emergence of numerous general-purpose data repositories, at scales ranging from institutional (for example, a single university), to open globally-scoped repositories such as Dataverse7 , FigShare (http://figshare.com), Dryad8, Mendeley Data (https://data.mendeley.com/), Zenodo (http:// zenodo.org/), DataHub (http://datahub.io), DANS (http://www.dans.knaw.nl/), and EUDat9'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``The resulting data ecosystem, therefore, appears to be moving away from centralization, is becoming more diverse, and less integrated, thereby exacerbating the discovery and re-usability problem for both human and computational stakeholders.'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``what formats is it in, is it searchable, and how? Once the data is discovered, can it be downloaded? In what format(s)? Can that format be easily integrated with private in-house data (the local dataset of alternative polyadenylation sites) as well as other data publications from third-parties and with the community's core gene/protein data repositories? Can this integration be'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
(Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``done automatically to save time and avoid copy/paste errors? Does the researcher have permission to use the data from these third-party researchers, under what license conditions, and who should be cited if a data-point is re-used?'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 3)
\par
``The reason that we often need several weeks (or months) of specialist technical effort to gather the data necessary to answer such research questions is not the lack of appropriate technology; the reason is, that we do not pay our valuable digital objects the careful attention they deserve when we create and preserve them.'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 3)
\par
``The goal is for scholarly digital objects of all kinds to become `first class citizens' in the scientific publication ecosystem, where the quality of the publication\textemdash and more importantly, the impact of the publication\textemdash is a function of its ability to be accurately and appropriately found, re- used, and cited over time, by all stakeholders, both human and mechanical.'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 3)
\par
``From the deliberations at the workshop the notion emerged that, through the definition of, and widespread support for, a minimal set of community-agreed guiding principles and practices, all stakeholders could more easily discover, access, appropriately integrate and re-use, and adequately cite, the vast quantities of information being generated by contemporary data-intensive science.'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 3)
\par
``The significance of machines in data-rich research environments'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 3)
\par
``Humans and machines often face distinct barriers when attempting to find and process data on the Web. Humans have an intuitive sense of `semantics' (the meaning or intent of a digital object) because we are capable of identifying and interpreting a wide variety of contextual cues, whether those take the form of structural/visual/iconic cues in the layout of a Web page, or the content of narrative notes. As such, we are less likely to make errors in the selection of appropriate data or other digital objects, although humans will face similar difficulties if sufficient contextual metadata is lacking. The primary limitation of humans, however, is that we are unable to operate at the scope, scale, and speed necessitated by the scale of contemporary scientific data and complexity of e-Science. It is for this reason that humans increasingly rely on computational agents to undertake discovery and integration tasks on their behalf. This necessitates machines to be capable of autonomously and appropriately acting when faced with the wide range of types, formats, and access-mechanisms/protocols that will be encountered during their self-guided exploration of the global data ecosystem. It also necessitates that the machines keep an exquisite record of provenance such that the data they are collecting can be accurately and adequately cited. Assisting these agents, therefore, is a critical consideration for all participants in the data management and stewardship process\textemdash from researchers and data producers to data repository hosts.'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 3)
\par
``This information enables the agent\textemdash to a degree dependent on \\
the amount of detail provided\textemdash to have the capacity, when faced with a digital object never \\
encountered before, to: a) identify the type of object (with respect to both structure and intent), b) \\
determine if it is useful within the context of the agent's current task by interrogating metadata and/ \\
or data elements, c) determine if it is usable, with respect to license, consent, or other accessibility or \\
use constraints, and d) take appropriate action, in much the same manner that a human would.'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 3) Agent is referring to a computer acting on behalf of a human.
\par
``addition, the idea of being machine-actionable applies in two contexts\textemdash first, when referring to the contextual metadata surrounding a digital object (`what is it?'), and second, when referring to the content of the digital object itself (`how do I process it/integrate it?').'' (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 4)
\par
``Creating bespoke parsers, in all computer languages, for all data-types and all analytical tools that require those data-types, is not a sustainable activity. As such, the focus on assisting machines in their discovery and exploration of data through application of more generalized interoperability technologies and standards at the data/repository level, becomes a first-priority for good data stewardship.''

  abstract = {Rangelands of the western Great Plains of North America are complex social-ecological systems where management objectives for livestock production, grassland bird conservation, and vegetation structure and composition converge. The Collaborative Adaptive Rangeland Management (CARM) experiment is a 10-year collaborative adaptive management (CAM) project initiated in 2012 that is aimed at fostering science-management partnerships and data-driven rangeland management through a participatory, multistakeholder approach. This study evaluates the decision-making process that emerged from the first 4 yr of CARM. Our objectives were to 1) document how diverse stakeholder experiences, epistemologies, and resulting knowledge contributed to the CARM project, 2) evaluate how coproduced knowledge informed management decision making through three grazing seasons, and 3) explore the implications of participation in the CARM project for rangeland stakeholders. We evaluated management decision making as representatives from government agencies and conservation nongovernmental organizations, ranchers, and interdisciplinary researchers worked within the CARM experiment to 1) prioritize desired ecosystem services; 2) determine objectives; 3) set stocking rates, criteria for livestock movement among pastures, and vegetation treatments; and 4) select monitoring techniques that would inform decision making. For this paper, we analyzed meeting transcripts, interviews, and focus group data related to stakeholder group decision making. We find two key lessons from the CARM project. First, the CAM process makes visible, but does not reconcile differences between, stakeholder experiences and ways of knowing about complex rangeland systems. Second, social learning in CAM is contingent on the development of trust among stakeholder and researcher groups. We suggest future CAM efforts should 1) make direct efforts to share and acknowledge managers' different rangeland management experiences, epistemologies, and knowledge and 2) involve long-term research commitment in time and funding to social, as well as experimental, processes that promote trust building among stakeholders and researchers over time.},

  abstract = {Aim: To clarify the concepts and terms that have been used in recording plant canopies and the methods used for measuring them. Concepts: The concepts considered are coven top cover, repeated cover, number of layers, proportion of repeated cover and leaf area index (LAI). Variants include canopy cover, basal area and leaf area density. Other terms have been used in the past, some are now ambiguous and some are counter-intuitive. Measurement: Cover and its related concepts can be measured by point intercept, line intercept, angle sampling, charting and image analysis, canopy transmittance, complete enumeration, clipping and allometry. The common procedure of adding the cover of individual species to calculate a "total cover" is invalid: a nonsense number is produced. Other measures of abundance: Cover-abundance, density, frequency, biomass and calorific values can also be used to measure abundance. They are related to cover. Especially, shoot frequency at a point is cover (the point intercept method). Subjective estimates: There are severe problems with cover-abundance scales, such as that of Braun-Blanquet. Estimation of abundance "by eye", by "informed guess", etc. has too often compromised results in vegetation science.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

  abstract = {Soil or sediment redistribution prediction along hillslopes and within small watersheds is considered to be a great challenge for the application of watershed erosion models in predicting the impact of soil and water conservation measures as well as for the redistribution of pollution such as radioactive fallout. In this study, long-term soil loss and deposition were estimated for two nested semi-arid watersheds within the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Southeastern Arizona using the process-based Geo-spatial interface of WEPP (GeoWEPP). While soil parameters were previously parametrized and validated through watershed outlet runoff and sediment yields, the channel parameters were adjusted and validated based on reference values of soil redistribution generated from fallout radionuclide 137Cs samples within the watersheds. Two methods were applied for the soil redistribution analysis by comparing observed and simulated soil loss/deposition rates (a) at single pixels and reference values at the specific location of each 137Cs sample site; and (b) for average values of a 5 m radius around each 137Cs sample site to compensate for measurement and model uncertainties. Surprisingly, soil redistribution predictions improved as topographic data resolution increased from 5 m to 3 m and were best at 1 m without changing key model parameters that were originally derived at the watershed scale.},
