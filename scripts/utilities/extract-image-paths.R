## This R Script when executed in R will create a .csv file (Comma seperated values) that stores the
## name, date and time of every photo in a folder.  All the data from this .csv file can then be copied into the
## Excel form for photo classification.
##
## This script should be stored in a directory with the photos to be classified. The photos can be in the same
##	directory as this script and in subfolders within this directory.
##
## If images are organized by trap-site, then naming image storage folders after each trap-site is good practice as
## the image path (with the trapsite folder names) will be included in the data produced by this script.
## the name of the folder can be extracted from the image path using simple R commands (e.g., "substr()" or "rep()")
## or Excel functions (e.g. "=MID()") and trapsite names can be linked to trapsite covariates stored in anotther
## spreadsheet or file (using "match" in R or "vLOOKUP" in Excel)
##
## There are two sets of optional settings.
##		1. define a subset of the available images to include based on time (rather than all images)
##		2. define a schedule when an custome pop-up alter message will appear on the excel form.
##
## If these options are not desired, the entire script can be run in R without alteration. the code is annoated to provide
## an explanation of the process, should this need to be update

# set the working directory to read in the files from the correct location on your hard drive (or on an external hard drive)
# the files you need to access might be in a different location on your computer therefore you likely will need to change the line below
setwd(file.path(root_folder, main_folder, location_folder, site_folder, collection_folder))

# double check the working directory to make sure its correct
getwd()

## get the current directory, if this script was copied into the image storage folder, then
## the working directory is that folder.
